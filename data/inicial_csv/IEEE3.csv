It empowers students to enhance problem-solving skills by decomposing problems, utilizing abstraction and pattern recognition, and employing algorithmic thinking to design solutions and build models. This is particularly important in STEM disciplines where logical reasoning is essential for addressing complex real-world challenges in academic and industrial settings. Given the increasing demand for professionals equipped with strong algorithmic thinking and problem-solving abilities in Industry 5, educational institutions are focusing on enhancing students' CT and problem-solving skills. This study presents an initiative conducted over the past two years at our institute to teach CT in a gateway course to students with different backgrounds in STEM fields. The approach involved designing specific learning modules on Abstraction, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, and Algorithmic Thinking and integrating them into the LMS. After studying these learning modules, the students were exposed to specific assignments that required the application of related CT skills. Pre and post surveys were employed by using standard CT tests to measure the impact of the intervention on students' CT levels. The results indicated an improvement in students' perceptions of their mastery of CT. Academic course grades also showed an improvement, with increased A scores and reduced F grades post-intervention. This two-year study on improving CT skills has yielded promising results. Moving forward, the research aims to enhance the existing modules further and distribute them to a broader range of introductory-level STEM courses in other universities. This future direction aligns with the goal of expanding the impact of CT education and integrating it more widely into STEM curricula.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-5280-1","10.1109/ISEC61299.2024.10664997","Kennesaw State University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10664997","Computational Thinking;Higher Education;Integrated STEM Education;Student Performance","Surveys;Industries;Computational modeling;Focusing;Logic gates;Cognition;Pattern recognition","","","","12","IEEE","17 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need for CT-related skills includes various fields, such as robotics, engineering, computer science, mathematics, music, arts, and humanities. Therefore, adopting robotic learning with CT and AT can enhance learning skills over the conventional learning model. This paper presents a systematic literature review on CT and AT practices in robotics learning to improve educational methods. This study conducts a systematic literature review from four databases: ACM, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and ScienceDirect. Sixty-five studies in robotics learning to increase CT and AT skills were analyzed by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study’s findings show that CT and AT are significant in training students to engage in robotics learning activities. These considerations will lead to strengthening their skill and critical thinking. The study also suggests that integrating these skills can prepare teachers for critical thinking and boost student learning. The findings suggest that CT and AT can directly adopt digital adversarial learning skills to improve overall robotics learning activities. For future studies, the difference in learning ages related to robotics activities with CT and AT applications can be studied to deeply comprehend the effectiveness of CT and AT applications.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249761","Ministry of Higher Education via a Research Grant Award(grant numbers:FRGS/1/2019/ICT02/UKM/02/9); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054368","Robotics;computational thinking;adversarial thinking;experiential learning model","Robots;Computational modeling;Systematics;Education;Mathematical models;Learning systems;Adaptation models;Fourth Industrial Revolution","","3","","131","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address this challenge, this study proposes a method using in-game features to assess self-efficacy, which can change over the playtime. The employed in-game feature is the Planning Stage, in which learners strategize and prepare their approach before engaging with challenges. We collect data on the time spent in this stage, which is newly proposed in this study. The experiment was conducted with twenty-five students in the Multimedia Technology and Animation Major playing Tenacity-P to accomplish tasks from a computer programming course. To validate the method, we compared self-efficacy results from the game-based approach with those from conventional questionnaires. The findings highlight the need for strategic planning in managing difficult tasks. As challenges increased, performance measures varied more, underscoring the importance of strong problem-solving skills. Efficient strategic planning directly improved self-efficacy, as participants with better planning skills maintained higher self-efficacy despite increasing task difficulty.","","979-8-3503-6260-2","10.1109/TIMES-iCON61890.2024.10630739","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10630739","Computational Thinking;Educational game;Game features;Self-efficacy","Games;Strategic planning;Innovation management;Animation;Particle measurements;Real-time systems;Problem-solving","","","","25","IEEE","15 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT perspective promotes the formation of computational identity through the internalization of concepts. At present, there are relatively few studies on the CT perspective. Based on this, this study proposes a design-based STEM + AI teaching model, aiming to create a combination of artificial intelligence and interdisciplinary to cultivate pupils ‘ CT perspective and form their computational identity. In this study, a single group of pre-test and post-test experiments were conducted to test the CT perspective and computational identity of students in the third grade of a primary school in Wuhan. The research shows that the design-based STEM + AI teaching has significantly improved the expression ability and questioning ability of primary school students in the CT perspective, as well as the correlation ability, participation ability, realization ability, and goal-setting ability in the computational identity.

Additionally, the popularity of GBL has grown in computer science and programming courses, where it can be used to develop computational thinking (CT) skills. CT is critical thinking used to apply fundamental concepts and reasoning derived from computing and computer science. Research has shown that digital GBL can improve critical thinking skills and help learners understand programming concepts, structures, and problem-solving strategies. Despite the popularity of digital GBL, analog card games and bingo games are still valuable and effective tools for learning. However, most studies on GBL that aim to train critical thinking skills have focused on digital approaches. This indicates a gap in the body of knowledge because few studies have explored the effectiveness of analog games for developing CT skills through GBL. The theoretical framework of this study is grounded in two learning theories. Constructivist theory frames learning as the construction of knowledge through a process of action, reflection, and construction. Constructionist learning theory calls for construction of artifacts, learner agency, authentic purpose, or authentic audience during the process. To investigate the design of GBL for developing CT skills and to generate discourse for its widespread adoption, the current study implemented design-based research (DBR) in an undergraduate computer science course for non-computer science majors. By addressing the gap in the literature on GBL for CT skill development, the study aimed to investigate complex learner experiences, including learner struggles and successes, alignment with learning theory principles, and design moves for future iterations of the project. The research question posed is: how can we optimize CT learning through GBL, based on learner experiences and learning theories? Prior to this study, the instructor used GBL in which learners played an analog, three-dimensional tic-tac-toe game with ping pong balls and then wrote a computer program that simulated that game. We chose to conduct DBR to strengthen the learning associated with this activity. DBR uses iterative designs to develop knowledge that improves educational practices. In the spring of 2023, we assessed the extent to which the non-digital game and programming the simulated game enhanced learners' CT skills by analyzing their experiences with CT. This involved collecting and analyzing learner surveys to gain insight into their learning experiences. Using network analysis and betweenness centrality measures, the data will be analyzed to identify learner struggles and successes. The results are expected to be available by August 2023. The contributions of this study include identifying effective design principles for GBL, optimizing CT learning, and generating discourse for the widespread adoption of GBL in computer science education.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342931","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342931","game-based learning (GBL);design-based research (DBR);computational thinking;computer science;undergraduate;constructivist;constructionist;analog","Surveys;Education;Digital simulation;Games;Solids;Reflection;Computer science education","","","","30","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many countries have begun programming education in elementary schools. As is a relatively new subject in elementary education, the course design and textbooks for programming education remain under development. The growth trend in computational thinking (CT) is helpful for educators to teach suitable programming concepts to students. Scratch, which is mostly used as an introductory programming language for elementary school students, can be evaluated to reflect students’ CT. In this work-in-progress research, we conducted a data-driven analysis on fourth-grade students’ CT growth in their first 3 years of programming learning by evaluating their Scratch projects. A preliminary result shows that CT grows rapidly in the first 2 years and tends to be stable in the third year. The reasons for the difference in growth of specific CT concepts are discussed.","2473-7623","979-8-3503-0001-7","10.1109/ISEC57711.2023.10402181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10402181","Computational thinking;Elementary school;Programming education;Scratch","Computer languages;Education;Market research;Programming profession","","","","9","IEEE","23 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In today’s fast-paced digital age, possessing CT abilities is essential for effective critical thinking and problem-solving across various fields. To cultivate CT proficiency in students from diverse disciplines, we designed an innovative adaptive gamified e-learning platform called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ). The eight key features of CTQ are (1) interactive storyline with customizable avatars, mini-games, and questions; (2) performance profiler; (3) comprehensive question bank with questions at three difficulty levels; (4) feedback and answer to each question; (5) additional learning resources via hyperlinks; (6) badges and leaderboard; (7) progress saving feature; and (8) integrated online feedback survey. The CTQ was introduced to recently enrolled first-year undergraduate students across all five discipline clusters at Singapore Institute of Technology. The learning performance and feedback of 135 students were gathered and examined. The student population comprised 33 Business, Communication and Design (BCD); 48 Health and Social Science (HSS); and 54 Infocomm Technology (ICT) undergraduates. Statistical results from the paired Student’s t-test reveal significant differences (p < 0.05) (i) between the pre-test and post-test scores for HSS, ICT, and all students combined; (ii) between the pre-test duration and post-test duration for all three clusters and all students combined; (iii) between the self-assessed knowledge score before CTQ and after completing CTQ for all three clusters and all students combined. Moreover, majority of the students commented that the CTQ generates interest in CT, is an engaging learning platform with enriching educational content, and has motivated their independent learning. Lastly, CTQ functions as an online preparatory course aimed at reducing the diversity in academic backgrounds and varying levels of prior knowledge of computer programming languages among students. This will help smoothly transition students into programming-relevant modules, and ultimately enhance the effectiveness of teaching and learning.","","978-1-6654-5331-8","10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398325","computational thinking;adaptive learning;gamification;independent learning;online education;multiple disciplines","Surveys;Computer languages;Electronic learning;Education;Sociology;Games;Problem-solving","","","","30","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In 2018, Yang and Li proposed that the physiological basis for the formation of memories and concepts in the human brain is engram cells (interneuron), and creative thinking is the process of forming new engram cells to connect previously seemingly unrelated concepts. During this process, association and prediction play a key role. In this study, a computational model based on engram cell theory was coded in Python to mimic the process of creative thinking. The validity of the model was tested by simulating the phenomenon of language generation and summarizing the artificial food-set regularity in the plus maze. The results show that, given 29 initial words and certain grammatical rules, the language generation program generates 25,405 sentences after 130,000 calculations, and these generated sentences can be combined into various short paragraphs. After 50 times of training in the cross maze puzzle solving program, the model can master 100% of the rules of artificial food settings. In conclusion, a computational model of creative thinking based on engram cell theory can creatively and automatically generate sentences and paragraphs, and can learn and summarize laws to solve simple puzzles. We plan to further use this model to address complex real-world problems, such as the study of cancer therapeutic targets","","979-8-3503-3984-0","10.1109/CAI54212.2023.00121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10195075","creative thinking;engram cell theory;computational model;language generation;puzzle solution","Training;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Brain modeling;Physiology;Creativity;Python","","","","5","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the 21st century, learners are expected to master important skills, which are difficult to teach in conventional lectures, such as computational thinking, critical thinking, creativity, and abstract reasoning. [1] Therefore, computer science or information technology courses often limit the discussion of recursion to calculating a factorial or a Fibonacci number, even though recursion is presented as an academic-type oddity in most cases. [2] To elucidate how VR can improve students’ computational thinking skills and abstract thinking associated with solving problems that require recursive algorithms, this paper examines the use of VR in computer science education to teach the abstract concept of recursion. The results of learners using VR Tower of Hanoi software are compared to those using the conventional Hanoi puzzle. Most learners show an improved understanding after experiencing the gameplay in the VR software, and some demonstrate a better understanding of recursion.

Correlation analysis was conducted to examine their relationships. We analyzed their relationships using correlation analysis and generalized structural equation modeling (GSEM). The results of the correlation analysis showed both weak positive correlations and weak negative correlations between the immersion factor and CT skills, indicating the importance of striking an appropriate balance between increasing player immersion and improving CT skills during game design. The results of generalized structural equation modeling revealed that while increased presence promoted creativity, high immersion hurt algorithmic thinking, flow state hurt problem-solving skills, and the factor of game immersion had no significant effect on cooperative skills. These findings suggest the importance of considering game design elements that target specific cognitive abilities in designing game-based health promotion and treatment programs.

Specifically, our gamified learning system is designed to make learning more fun, engaging, and effective through game and experiment elements that align with science and math learning standards. It will also increase systematic problem-solving and algorithmic reasoning for K-12 students. Since the human body can be thought of as a combination of interacting systems, the game also introduces students to computational thinking by introducing internal body functions. To achieve these goals, this project has two components. First, an educational virtual reality game will be built according to the natural human body structure. During the game process, students will experience the same as the human body functions, travel along the blood circulation, help with the heartbeat, and participate in oxygen exchange. While students are playing the game, our gamified adaptive learning system tracks and controls the student's learning progress. As the AI component collects student data and uses this information, our system adjusts game content and addresses possible learner issues to refine the learning curriculum for a faster and more effective learning experience. Second, a series of hands-on activities will be conducted based on the functions of the human body (e.g., developing an artificial heart and experiencing how the heart works). Through this project, an attractive and efficient next-generation learning system will be developed and used to expose K-12 students to this learning system. The education of students will be accomplished in different dimensions through games and hands-on practice, respectively. Additionally, compared to traditional learning methods, our learning system not only increases students' interest in learning but also makes it more personalized compared to the conventional learning process. Likewise, we will refer to the results of self-efficacy surveys administered to students and teachers separately to test their perceptions of their abilities and the new system.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342946","Gamification;Educational Software;Learning Technology;Computational Thinking;Systematic Thinking","Learning systems;Heart;Systematics;Games;Virtual reality;Cognition;Teamwork","","","","15","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These challenges arise from the inherent complexity of concepts like stress, strain, torsion, and buckling, which are difficult to observe, hindering comprehension. Therefore, this work aims to leverage the synergy between mechanics of materials and computational principles to actively engage students in advanced topics such as structural strength, failure of structures, and sensitivity analysis, through the use of computational notebooks. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we first asked students to analyze truss structures using hand calculations following the discrete stiffness method within a Finite Element Analysis framework. Subsequently, we implemented the same method as a simulation tool in a MATLAB Computational Notebook. Finally, we asked the students to reflect on: (1) the value of using computational methods to approach Finite Element Analysis when compared to hand calculations; (2) the difficulties they faced when implementing the activities in the MATLAB Computational Notebook; (3) the support they required to successfully complete these activities; and (4) the effectiveness of the simulation tool in understanding the effect of forces and stress distributions in structures. We anticipate that computational notebooks will provide an ideal platform for sharing lessons and tutorials, enhancing student engagement, and promoting active learning. Students have access to the complete source code, allowing them to develop computational skills. Early exposure to coding, modeling, and simulation techniques is crucial in preparing students for the computational demands of modern engineering workplaces.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342890","NSF(grant numbers:2237313); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342890","Computational notebooks;mechanics of materials;computational thinking;threshold concepts;Finite Element Analysis","Visualization;Sensitivity analysis;Source coding;Tutorials;Reflection;Finite element analysis;Mechanical engineering","","","","13","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These skills are basic pillars of Computational thinking (CT) and are essential for a computer programmer. Therefore, a programming teacher needs to take these skills into account for the evaluation of students. Existing methods for improving programming competency don’t consider the Computational Thinking of students and perform grading of students without taking these skills into account. Due to this limitation, deficiencies of these skills in students remain unrevealed, posing difficulties for educators to provide need-oriented feedback. The performance of programming students is thus hindered by a lack of interventions. This study proposes a method to evaluate programming students in terms of CT skill components and group them based on their skill set. In this study, 780 students of object-oriented programming (OOP) class were given programming assignments for assessment of programming competencies. These students were then given small programming tasks requiring different computational thinking skill components for their solutions. A machine learning approach was used to perform grouping of these students based on their scores. Six groups of programming students, each having its own set of skill deficiencies, were identified as a result of clustering. One of the groups had an empty set of skill deficiencies and consisted of students proficient in programming. Each of the other five groups had a non-empty set of skill deficiencies and comprised non-proficient programming students. A group-specific skill development plan was built for the groups having skill deficiencies. It was found that such feedback was very effective and improved the CT skill deficiencies of 82% of students.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3391873","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506466","Computational thinking assessment;feedback;K-means clustering;programming","Programming;Programming profession;Codes;Task analysis;Source coding;Clustering algorithms;Feedback;Cognitive systems;Object oriented programming;Machine learning;Education;Performance evaluation","","","","33","CCBYNCND","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to solve the problem of assessment limitations, this paper defines the content of CT evaluation from the perspective of text-based programming and constructs a multidimensional test method. Different test schemes are selected according to the characteristics of CT skills, and assessment tools are developed by combining the question test, programming test and scale survey, and the assessment tools are used to evaluate and analyze learners' CT skills from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. The results show that the evaluation indicators and test questions designed on text-based programming are more consistent with the evaluation objectives.

As an approach to engineering education, it aims to create an active, experiential learning setting where product and process are considered fundamental to the curriculum. Modern pedagogical strategies and innovative teaching methods allow for the implementation of the CDIO approach, where students are supported to develop deep knowledge, manage the process of designing and exploiting new items and systems, and evaluate the impact of the scientific-technological process on society. This article will highlight aspects of this approach in the development of a practical quantum electronics session. In particular, it will focus on the developed principles of an innovative practice-targeted programme that can support the development of students' engineering thinking through the linkage of education and professional activities. As graduates, the students will need to be able to create innovative engineering systems as well as integrate their understanding of natural and technological sciences to generate novel concepts. They will also need to be proficient in professional ethics and have knowledge of business and entrepreneurship fundamentals. As such, this indicates the need for a strategically-focused curriculum that supports the development of a range of transversal skills required for industry.

The study describes a creative blended pedagogy that embeds the proposed model into the course plan. Background: The emergence of artificial intelligent systems such as large language models from a knowledge provider perspective, coupled with a gradual change in post-pandemic outlook of education challenge the relevance and raises concerns about the future of education. The 21st-century human CT requirements, viz., learning to code (skill) and thinking computationally (competency), will be inadequate in the future. Moreover, there is substantial evidence which shows that most introductory programming courses fail to integrate critical elements like ethics and responsibility as part of the course. Intended Outcomes: The authors anticipate experiential learning models such as this has immense potential to future-proof CS education, as well as make future software engineers responsible citizens. Application Design: The proposed model blends six types of thinking into the design and activities of the course.

Therefore, this study designed a game-based project to investigate students’ learning motivation and CT performance in different programming environments. A total of 108 fifth-grade students participated in the experiment and were divided into two experimental groups (EG1 and EG2) and a control group (CG). The students in experimental groups all undertook game-based learning, while EG1 students used C++ and EG2 students used Scratch; CG students used C++ for traditional algorithm-based learning. Findings suggest that traditional programming languages with game-based learning can also substantially improve learning interest, which can promote the efficiency of improving CT for students who already have some motivation and foundation for learning. But for students who still lack motivation, are also encouraged to develop an interest in a block-based programming environment. Teachers can choose the most appropriate approach for students to find the best balance between learning efficiency and long-term interest.","2475-1510","","10.1109/TG.2022.3143701","Computer Center of the Children's Palace, China Welfare Institute; Osaka University Foundation for Future; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684681","Computational thinking (CT);elementary education;game-based learning;learning motivation;programming","Programming profession;Education;Programming environments;Games;Computer languages;C++ languages;Problem-solving","","5","","46","IEEE","18 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in CT integration, we surveyed the perceptions and intentions of teachers in tertiary education in the Netherlands. Our survey encompassed two aspects: (1) teachers' perceptions of CT, and (2) their intentions to integrate CT into pedagogical activities. 38 teachers, mostly in Engineering Education, from across the Netherlands completed the questionnaire based on the UTAUT framework. Regarding CT perceptions, our investigation reveals that teachers possess an inadequate understanding of the relationship between CT and Computer Science, have limited training experiences in CT, and hold differing opinions on when and which constructs of CT should be integrated into different domains. Concerning teachers' intentions to integrate CT, the results exhibited a strong positive correlation between performance expectancy, attitude towards CT, and behavioral intention to implement CT in learning activities. To foster the integration of CT in tertiary education, our findings suggest the need for further development of higher education teacher training programs focused on CT and its relation to CS.

This classifier draws inspiration from the human visual system and human thinking logic. The architecture consists of five layers, each serving a distinct purpose. In the initial convolutional layer, informative and distinct features are extracted, mimicking the functionality of the human visual system. The subsequent clustering layer employs a clustering algorithm to group samples within a class into smaller clusters. This arrangement allows the following layer to compare test samples across different clusters, replicating a human-like classification process where the most similar samples should belong to the same group. The hashing layer of the devised system employs a similarity-preserve hashing technique to transform feature maps into hashed data.

Diverse studies reveal that the initial decision about the vocation in studies is made towards the end of the primary education stage, also from 8–9 years old. The Digital Transformation Commission of the Engineering Associations of Catalonia is concerned about the low number of young people who decide to pursue STEM studies. STEM explorations in early childhood lay the foundation for lifelong learning. In addition, from age 5, children informally begin to practice proportional reasoning, and in the third year of primary school (8–9 years old), the subject is formally introduced into the Primary Education curriculum. The notion of proportionality is very transversal, and it is one of the fundamental concepts of the STEM field. The consequences of an incomplete understanding of it directly or indirectly affect the attitude of subjects toward mathematics and the STEM world. With the emergence of Industry 4.0, the digital twin concept is becoming one of the central instruments of Digital Transformation. In this paper, we propose using computational thinking to help the understanding of proportional thinking using a physical and digital twin pair. In 2022, computational thinking was introduced into the Spanish and Catalan educational system's early childhood, primary, and secondary education curricula. It includes programming with block languages such as Scratch or Snap!. A digital twin of the system has also been implemented in Snap!. Through the collaboration of a primary school, a workshop has been prepared in which they exercise the concepts of proportional reasoning, such as ratio, proportion, scale, or percentage. The approach followed has consisted of developing a physical system of a floating ball, controlling the electric motor's power with an electronic system based on low-cost elements from the maker world. We have designed a very easy-to-use system for any teacher, and its open-source nature ensures its transparency and documentation. The foam ball rises and remains floating at a height determined by the power supplied to the motor. The control of the system is carried out with Snap!. It will be assumed that the engine revolutions are proportional to the power setpoint. The physical system generates a high level of expectation and attention in the students, facilitating the process of its abstraction. The range of options of the developed system allows experimenting with the actual system and a schematic digital twin with sound effects. In all cases, the same computational thinking tools have been used to exercise the concepts and powerful ideas of proportional reasoning. At the end of the workshop, the understanding of the concepts exercised and the assessment of their personal experience were evaluated. This gave us helpful information to motivate students of these ages and below to maintain their STEM vocation.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578918","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578918","Microworlds;Digital Twin;STEM;Computational Thinking;Proportional Reasoning","Computers;Instruments;Conferences;Toy manufacturing industry;Documentation;Cognition;Digital twins","","","","29","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities.","","978-1-6654-5331-8","10.1109/TALE56641.2023.10398358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10398358","Large Language Models;Interactive Learning Environments;Collaborative Learning;Human-Computer Interaction","Computational modeling;Education;Chatbots;User experience;Software;Task analysis;Springs","","","","31","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system’s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students’ capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3349979","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10380594","Instructional design;support vector machine;K-means clustering;innovative thinking;instructional system","Clustering algorithms;Support vector machines;Programming profession;Programming;Kernel;Classification algorithms;Educational technology","","","","50","CCBYNCND","4 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges.

To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks. The differences between BERT, USE, and proposed algorithms are discussed in relation to the assessment of creativity, and the implications for future work are explored in-depth.","","979-8-3503-3428-9","10.1109/ECEI57668.2023.10105336","National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology(grant numbers:YJ20210266); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105336","Divergent Thinking Assessment;Natural Language Processing;Alternative Uses Task;Crowdsourcing","Technological innovation;Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Semantics;Manuals;Transformers;Natural language processing","","1","","26","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578653","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578653","Computational thinking;Mathematics;Early childhood education;STEM;STEAM","Systematics;Reviews;Knowledge acquisition;Solids;Data processing;Mathematics;Engineering education","","","","52","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Jackson","University of Hull, UK",Critical Systems Thinking: A Practitioner's Guide,"","2024","","","47","68","Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision‐makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, ‘systemic critique’, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, ‘systemic pluralism’, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, ‘systemic improvement’, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to ‘systemic pragmatism’. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>","","9781394203581","10.1002/9781394203604.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10534124.pdf&bkn=10534082&pdfType=chapter","","Systems thinking;Complexity theory;Floods;Adaptation models;Stakeholders;Observers;Computational modeling","","","","","","17 May 2024","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"

By introducing programming concepts through unplugged CT activities, this research significantly contributed to the growth of interest and the development of skills among secondary school students. Two hundred and thirty lower secondary school students volunteered to participate in the intervention using a designed unplugged CT activity framework. The CT activities framework consists of four components: puzzles, the Bebras Computing Challenge, problem-solving, and programming concepts. Four schools participated in three- to four-day interventions for four to five hours daily. Quantitative data collection was performed using pre- and post-surveys before and after the intervention phase. A paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated the p-value < 0.05 suggested a significant improvement in interest and programming skills.

QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information.

Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions.

One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.","","979-8-3503-0268-4","10.1109/ICOCO59262.2023.10397736","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10397736","UTAUT;computational thinking;unplugged learning","Surveys;Correlation;Computational modeling;Hybrid learning","","","","31","IEEE","24 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to design a CT training program supported by a rigorous framework, we decided to build an ontology that goes deeper into the underlying concepts and relates both domains, CT and CP.

The quantitative data from in-game analyses show that students utilized the language change feature to switch from English to Spanish more frequently than the other way – highlighting the need for educational platforms relatable to students through language, environment, and cultural context. Analyses of the qualitative data indicate that while teachers/team members understood CT and translanguaging concepts and taught lesson units that provided opportunities to practice both, CT and translanguaging were largely implicit in the curriculum. In collaborative analyses of these patterns, teachers described additional supports that would help them to make CT instruction and translanguaging strategies more explicit in the content and pedagogy, highlighting the need for systematic, targeted integration of these concepts.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386409","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386409","Computational thinking;K-12 education;Computer games","Systematics;Education;Curriculum development;Collaboration;Games;Switches;Linguistics","","","","29","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We believe that CT skills should be developed and encouraged from a young age. However, to promote the development of CT it is necessary to use appropriate materials, which we call Learning Resources (LR). For a more efficient development of CT, it is important that the LR are designed and used in order to obtain the maximum potential of the resource. Scientific evidence from Neuroeducation can be used to fully explore LR. There are many LR available to promote CT, however, they are not correctly classified in order to be easy to understand what specific CT skills they stimulate, neither which ages they are adequate for. Directions for their most convenient usage are also lacking. This paper aims to present an approach to categorize these LR so that when a teacher intends to promote the development of one or more specific CT skills, in a given schooling year, he can find the adequate LR more easily, and also get educational resources concerning their use. This characterization approach is based on OntoCnE ontology. OntoCnE was built by us and is composed of 4 layers that define: how to develop CT (1); which concepts should be taught at each school level (2); which materials are appropriate for each skill (3); and the Neuroeducation guidelines associated with each resource (4). This paper essentially focuses on layers 3 and 4 to perform the LR characterization. To illustrate our approach, we will follow OntoCnE statements to categorize a set of LRs. With this methodological setting we intend to build a catalog of LR more effectively promote CT skills on children.","2476-2172","979-8-3503-7661-6","10.1109/SIIE63180.2024.10604485","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10604485","Computational Thinking;Ontology;OntoCnE;Learning Resources;Neuroeducation","Systematics;Education;Ontologies;Problem-solving;Programming profession;Guidelines","","","","16","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Background: CT cultivation and assessment methods are hot topics in the field of education. CT assessment can effectively test the effect of CT cultivation. There are many CT assessment methods, of which evaluation frameworks are an effective self-reporting assessment method. Existing studies on self-reported CT evaluation frameworks are commonly applicable to students at different stages.

These challenges can be mitigated by human-engineered systems exhibiting intelligent behavior. With the evolution of high-speed digital computers, the use of computational intelligence (CI) techniques has increased rapidly. According to Bezdek [1], “A system is called computationally intelligent if it deals with low-level data such as numerical data, has a pattern-recognition component and does not use knowledge in the artificial intelligence (AI) sense, and additionally when it begins to exhibit computational adaptivity, fault tolerance, speed approaching human-like turnaround and error rates that approximate human performance.” Another definition, by Engelbrecht [2], states that “CI is the study of adaptive mechanisms that enable or facilitate intelligent behavior in complex and changing environments. These mechanisms include those Artificial Intelligence paradigms that exhibit an ability to learn or adapt to new situations, to generalize, abstract, discover and associate.” Thus, CI is the general term used to classify all such nature-inspired methodologies and their associated theories and applications. The five important paradigms of the CI technique are artificial neural networks (ANNs), swarm intelligence (SI), evolutionary computation (EC), and fuzzy systems (FSs). The origin of each technique can be connected to a natural system; for example, an ANN imitates the biological neural system. SI models the behavior of organisms living in swarms, whereas EC models the natural evolution system. Similarly, an FS originates from human thinking processes. Many of the problems involved in designing next-generation systems can be resolved using these CI techniques or their combinations.","1557-9581","","10.1109/MMM.2023.3284764","Science and Engineering Research Board(grant numbers:VJR/2019/000009); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10209089","","Surveys;Evolution (biology);Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Artificial neural networks;Organisms;Behavioral sciences;Computational intelligence","","1","","71","IEEE","4 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Such problems are characterized by their presentation in natural language, eschewing the utilization of intricate mathematical symbols or formulas. The focal task of model geared towards addressing Math Word Problem is twofold: first, to discern and interpret the mathematical concepts encapsulated within the textual descriptions provided, and second, to formulate an appropriate mathematical expression or equation reflective of the problem's essence. Subsequently, these models proceed to compute the solution corresponding to the derived expression, thereby completing the problem-solving process. Currently, advancements in this domain primarily revolve around improvements to encoders and decoders within models, with a relatively narrow scope of thinking processes during model solving. Consequently, the efficacy of expression solving for complex semantic Math Word Problem remains to be enhanced. In contrast to the prevalent sequence-to-tree approach, humans often employ a top-down thinking process to solve Math Word Problem. We introduce a Math Word Problem solving model featuring a dual-thinking structure, comprising a top-down solver, a step-by-step anthropomorphic thinking solver, and a consistent comparison learning module. By aligning expressions derived from two distinct solvers at multiple granularities to maintain consistency, we aim to enhance reasoning correctness.

As part of a middle school science class, 90 students from the 6th and 7th grades participated in our study. All students first visually programmed dance choreography for a virtual character they created in VEnvI on a laptop. Then, they viewed and interacted with the resulting dance performance in a between-subjects design in one of the three conditions. We compared and contrasted the benefits of embodied immersive virtual reality (EVR) viewing utilizing a head-mounted display with a body-scaled and gender-matched self-avatar, immersive virtual reality only (IVR) viewing, and desktop VR (NVR) viewing with VEnvI on pedagogical outcomes, programming performance, presence, and attitudes towards STEM and computational thinking. Results from a cognition questionnaire showed that, in the learning dimensions of Knowledge and Understanding (Bloom's taxonomy) as well as Multistructural (SOLO taxonomy), participants in EVR and IVR scored significantly higher than NVR. Also, participants in EVR scored significantly higher than IVR. We also discovered similar results in objective programming performance and presence scores in VEnvI. Furthermore, students’ attitudes towards computer science, programming confidence, and impressions significantly improved to be the highest in EVR and then IVR as compared to NVR condition.

This model is suitable for GAI-assisted tasks (GAIATs). The parallel intelligence model is suitable for GAI-assisted learning (GAIAL); it is a method in which a person develops abilities by analyzing and comparing tasks created by GAI after going through the data-information-knowledge-work process.

However, the beauty of these frames is typically obscured by undesired blemishes such as occlusions and reflections. We address these restrictions by combining deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and adaptive neural splines, which surpass traditional image fusion and reveal the hidden brilliance inside. Acting like skilled artisans, the adaptive neural splines deftly separate and reweave the image's fabric. Their subtle touch safeguards every strand of visual information, ensuring the final result is a harmonious tapestry of enhanced clarity and preserved detail. This harmonic connection reveals itself in a transforming process that combines many frames into a single, stunning tapestry. Shadows reveal their secrets, the previously opaque depths now shining with clarity. Occlusions and reflections evaporate, leaving just a spotless canvas on which the scene's genuine brightness shines. The result is a symphony of increased clarity, with minute details emerging from darkness and textures dancing with unparalleled sharpness. The power of this invention is not just theoretical. Extensive comparisons to cutting-edge approaches demonstrate its revolutionary influence. Our model outperforms others in retaining fine detail, improving overall clarity, and maintaining visual integrity. These breakthroughs not only push the frontiers of computational photography but also serve as a catalyst for future advances in image processing and analysis.

The success of Produce rests on understanding the purposes, strengths and weaknesses of different systems methodologies. Five types of systems methodology are identified and described – engineering, system dynamics (SD), living, soft and emancipatory. These are shown to relate to the five systemic perspectives that were employed to provide an appreciation of the situation of interest in Explore. Examples are provided of how different methodologies were chosen as ‘dominant’ at different times to steer interventions. Finally, some possible objections to what Produce suggests are discussed.</p>","","9781394203581","10.1002/9781394203604.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10534128.pdf&bkn=10534082&pdfType=chapter","","Systems thinking;Schedules;Computational modeling;Testing;System dynamics;Sustainable development;Stakeholders","","","","","","17 May 2024","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"

Today’s 20-year-olds were forced to live one tenth of their lives, i.e., 2 years, locked in their homes, isolated from friends and university peers, during the COVID -19 pandemic. Hardly had they recovered from the threat of the pandemic, from their grief, when they were hit by another trauma, as were other members of society. War in neighbouring Ukraine, serious energy crisis, climate crisis, skyrocketing inflation, uncertain future…The focus of the research was therefore on the question of what kind of life they would be satisfied with, and what they would do to achieve the quality of life they want. What goals do they have, what do they want to achieve in their lives? Are human relationships important to them? As our interviewees were marketing students, we asked them if they were happy buying a product or using a service, how important is the experience of buying a product or service to them? How do they think about this topic, what strategy do they want to follow as marketing employees based on their life experiences? Their way of thinking is also decisive at a societal level.","2765-818X","979-8-3503-2110-4","10.1109/SACI58269.2023.10158648","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10158648","happiness;Z generation;value trends","Surveys;COVID-19;Pandemics;Market research;Informatics;Computational intelligence;Meteorology","","5","","21","IEEE","27 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Seeing the success of agile project management, more and more companies and businesses began to agileize their various organizational units as well, and finally the mindset spread to the whole organization. Today, we interpret the concept of agility not only at the organizational level, but also at the individual level. However, the willingness of individuals and employees to agility differs along a number of factors. It is influenced by an individual's age, generation affiliation, education, culture, which determines the extent to which he or she is able to embrace this new way of thinking. In our study, we look for the answer to what agility means as a term in the reading of respondents of each generation.

Our goal is to create models that replicate human cognition, paving the way for robots that think like us. Key concepts from Indian philosophy, including ”buddhi,” ”manas,” ”chit,” and ”ahamkar,” are woven into the framework, enhancing AI’s ability to understand and interact with the world in a more human-like way. The core of the framework consists of ”Buddhi” and ”Manas.” Buddhi, a discriminative AI component, adeptly navigates sensory data, making decisions aligned with human discernment. Complementing it, ”Manas” is a generative core, capable of crafting narratives and generating creative solutions. This synergy creates an iterative loop that encapsulates human thought, enabling machines to think, visualize, and even dream. In addition to advancing AI and ML research, we conducted an experiment using a modified News Aggregator dataset from the UCI repository. The experiment focused on word prediction, and our model, infused with Indian philosophy, outperformed RNN and LSTM models over 30 epochs. This framework has the potential to revolutionize AI and create more human-like machines, ushering in a new era of AI and robotics.","","979-8-3503-4023-5","10.1109/ICACRS58579.2023.10404103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10404103","Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Model of mind;Human way of thought","Philosophical considerations;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Predictive models;Robot sensing systems;Iterative methods;Artificial intelligence","","","","14","IEEE","26 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study introduces an innovative approach to implementing computational creativity in the scientific domain, exemplified through the automatic generation of trigonometric identities using a novel LeakGAN model, a Generative Adversarial Network with leaked information. The novelty of the proposed LeakGAN lies in its discriminator model, constructed on the foundation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), aimed at capturing the most relevant features from input data. These features are subsequently leaked to the generator model, enabling the production of identities with substantial originality and quality. The introduced novelty in the discriminator’s architecture encompasses the use of a new activation function called Mish, strategically employed to enhance the network's convergence rate and address over-fitting issues during training. Additionally, an attention layer is introduced to highlight the most relevant information within the feature space, thereby improving the network's learning capacity. Furthermore, a unique mixed pooling layer is utilized, combining the advantageous effects of max-pooling and average pooling operations to enhance the network's adaptability to varying feature distributions. Performance analysis, incorporating BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) metrics and various comparative studies, substantiates the efficacy of the proposed LeakGAN model in generating novel identities compared to its traditional counterparts. Moreover, human evaluation involving 20 mathematical experts confirms the significant novelty of the generated identities compared to existing standard textbook problems. Consequently, the proposed technique proves valuable for generating diverse trigonometric identities suitable for inclusion as chapter-end exercises in middle school mathematics textbooks.","2161-4407","979-8-3503-5931-2","10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650943","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10650943","computational creativity;LeakGAN;trigonometric identities;CNN","Geometry;Computational modeling;Computer architecture;Generative adversarial networks;Mathematical models;Generators;Data models","","","","41","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The difficulties vary from subject to subject. Teachers' first challenge in Computer Science (CS) and Computational Thinking teaching is their technological literacy and competency challenges. Lack of confidence, time, and willingness are significant reasons for the challenge. One of the studies on mathematics teaching shows that teachers need more knowledge tools and models to facilitate the analysis during the teaching process. Researchers assert that educational practice has focused more on technology than on new pedagogies needed to truly use technology in a transformative way. Frameworks are designed to meet high-level objectives set by the authorities. Teachers are provided with teaching materials for developing the course contents. The frameworks act as a connection between high-level objectives and low-level teaching materials. In this paper, we present the elaboration of a framework for teaching CS at the early stages of education. The framework consists of three components based on modelling real-world problems into a machine-world context and then realising the machine solution in the real world. Moreover, the problem-solving component of the framework emphasizes the iterative process of learning that strengthens the previous concepts and provides a logical con-nection between the previous and new concepts. The framework was evaluated in the context of Saudi Arabia, where the teachers were interviewed individually and then provided with a guide for teaching grade-4 learners. The guide was developed using the material provided by the Saudi Ministry of Education. The teachers taught using this guide over a sequence of lessons. At the end of this time, a second individual teacher interview was conducted to determine teacher experience. The results show that teaching using the framework is effective, and it is not only easier for teachers to understand the teaching method but also for learners to learn the content quickly.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342646","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342646","K-12;Computer Science Education;Computational Thinking","Computer science;Surveys;Computational modeling;Education;Mathematical models;Problem-solving;Iterative methods","","","","39","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This includes an appraisal process that models the factors leading to stress by assessing a person's relation to the environment and a coping process that models how people seek to reduce stress by directly altering the environment or changing one's beliefs and goals. We evaluated the model's assumptions in the context of a high-stress situation, hurricanes. We collected questionnaire data from major U.S. hurricanes in 2018 to evaluate the model's features for appraisal calculation. We also conducted a series of controlled experiments simulating a hurricane experience to investigate how people change their beliefs and goals to cope with the situation.

An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses.

Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method.

Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.","","979-8-3503-7069-0","10.1109/ICETA61311.2023.10343894","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343894","","Art;Education;Urban areas;Software;Planning;Informatics;Robots","","","","21","IEEE","12 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2024.3442612","Project KEGA titled by The Use of Artificial Intelligence in the Teaching of School Informatics in Secondary Schools(grant numbers:010UPJ,4/2024); Scientific Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Science, Research and Sport of the Slovak Republic titled by Proposal of Novel Methods in the Field of Formal Concept Analysis and their Application(grant numbers:VEGA 1/0645/22); Slovak Research and Development Agency(grant numbers:APVV-20-0069); Scientific Grant Agency (VEGA)(grant numbers:VEGA 2/0097/20); European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:313011BWH2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10669100","Attribute implications;formal concept analysis;light-bot;visualization","Games;Formal concept analysis;Education;Lighting;Programming profession;Lattices;Robots","","","","","IEEE","6 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

For this system, we use a squad dataset. The squad dataset is helpful for open-ended questions. The model uses NLP and the BERT question-answer model for handling the answers. Problem-solving deals with the analysis of questions and answering them in a creative, feasible, and efficient way. The problem-solving the approach gives the way of thinking of the problem solver. Computational methods along with NLP are being developed to calculate these indices. With the help of question-answer systems in NLP, the users’ answers are analyzed and measured are being attempts to perform such analysis but the answers to the questions are varied from person to person which makes answer analysis challenging. Answers given by users and answer for the question present in the squad dataset is compared by using cosine similarity to calculate the creativity index. The creativity index is a linear combination of fluency, flexibility, uniqueness, and elaboration indices; calculated for every given answer by comparing given answers and the stored answers. The system is trained and tested for the general questions present in the squad dataset. This system is beneficial to predict and measure the creative thinking, problem-solving ability, and thinking ability of the user. It helps to build the work culture, societal culture, and behavior of individuals in the institution, community, and workplace. The CI is a tremendously useful tool for businesses, office employees, and students. Thinking and problem-solving skills are calculated using this technique.","","979-8-3503-3860-7","10.1109/CONIT59222.2023.10205798","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10205798","NLP (Natural Language Processing);BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model;Cosine similarity;Creative Index (CI);Squad Dataset;Question Answering model","Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Natural languages;Employment;Transformers;Question answering (information retrieval);Indexes","","","","16","IEEE","7 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices.

Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme's performance with metrics like time comparison over a key generation, signcryption and unsigncryption.

The design thinking process and visual thinking tactics are two of the most popular methods. blockchain technology is up to the task of solving problems plaguing the higher education system and society as a whole. The blockchain's many benefits include less expensive transactions due to less time spent checking, controlling, and verifying data, as well as the presence of decentralized open data and the absence of forgeries and unsafe storing of information. The purpose of this study is to analyze the potential benefits and drawbacks of using blockchain technology in education, as well as the effects that this technology may have on the future of this sector. Although its rapid development, blockchain (BC) has not yet been widely included into the education of contemporary art. The purpose of this paper is to develop strategies for integrating BC into 21st-century art instruction. After examining how BC technologies are currently being utilized within the realm of contemporary art education, the writers assessed the issues associated with their utilization. As a result, three approaches to promoting BC facets of contemporary art learning were developed: bolstering the malleability of BC-based modern art learning, strengthening the innovative three education of art learning, and enhancing the recent art background and ambience of BC-based modern art learning. In this research, modern art education to be provided via a blockchain-based system (BC-MAT) is discussed to improve the student performance. Concurrently, a productivity analysis strategy using analytical hierarchical processing (AHP) and grey grouping was developed to assess BC's impact on today's art classrooms. The BC-MAT has numerous applications and can be used to determine how BC has affected modern art education.

Fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) have a strong formal description and fuzzy reasoning abilities, which align with human cognitive thinking. However, the traditional FPNs are challenging to describe the following problems: formally expressing the transformation relations between information granules and information granule levels, and then carrying out formal reasoning and decision making based on cognitive thinking mode. This article introduces the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation method to explore this problem. First, the problem of attribute information granulation is discussed by using the equivalence relation of attributes. Second, qualitative mapping is used to express the transformation relationship between information granules. The transformation relationship between attribute information granule levels is realized by qualitative criterion transformation, and the basic algebraic structure of attribute information granules is given. The basic network elements of FPNs can formally describe the relationships between these information granules.

Among them, the assessment of CT and code quality is mainly carried out from the program script, while the evaluation of visual aesthetics is analyzed from the perspective of image sequences generated by project execution. The single-view evaluation focuses on the performance of a program in a certain aspect and is one-sided. In this paper, we propose a multi-view evaluation framework to integrate various evaluations using different policies. We quantitatively analyze the assessment of different views driven by data.

Therefore, spreadsheets are of limited use when investigating the inherent uncertainties of such models and answering what-if questions. Existing extensions typically require a complex modeling process that cannot easily be embedded in a tabular layout. In Fuzzy Spreadsheet, a cell can hold and display a distribution of values. This integrated uncertainty-handling immediately conveys sensitivity and robustness information. The fuzzification of the cells enables calculations not only with precise values but also with distributions, and probabilities. We conservatively added and carefully crafted visuals to maintain the look and feel of a traditional spreadsheet while facilitating what-if analyses. Given a user-specified reference cell, Fuzzy Spreadsheet automatically extracts and visualizes contextually relevant information, such as impact, uncertainty, and degree of neighborhood, for the selected and related cells.

However, intruders find such complex and distributed infrastructures appealing targets for cyber-attacks. Cyber-attacks are severe threats that can jeopardize the quality of service provided to clients and compromise data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Cyber-attacks are becoming more complex, making it more challenging to detect intrusions effectively. Due to the high traffic and increased malicious activities on the Internet, a single Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can be overwhelmed. Despite the various Deep Learning (DL) approaches that have been proposed as alternative solutions, there are still pertinent security issues to be addressed especially in federated cloud computing domains. This work proposes a Secure Federated Intrusion Detection Model Version 1 (SecFedIDM-V1) using blockchain technology and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). The Cobourg Intrusion Detection Dataset (CIDDS) was acquired, pre-processed and split into 60:20:20, 70:15:15, and 80:10:10 for training, testing, and validation respectively to develop the proposed intrusion traffic classification component of the proposed model. The developed SecFedIDM-V1 was later deployed as a Python-based web application that captures network packets for classifying attacks into normal or an attack type. The attack packets are recorded in a Hyperledger Fabric (a private blockchain technology) to serve as a signature database to be used by other nodes in the network. From the evaluation results of the intrusion classifier, the 80:10:10 BiLSTM network performed better than GRU with a Precision of 0.99624, Recall of 0.99906, F1 Score of 0.99614, False Positive Rate (FPR) of 0.00094, False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.00395 and True Positive Rate (TPR) of 0.99605. The SecFedIDM-V1 can be deployed alongside Firewalls in a federated cloud computing environment to reinforce the security of the infrastructure.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3325992","Covenant Applied Informatics and Communication Africa Centre of Excellence (CApIC-ACE), domiciled at Covenant University with the ACE Impact Grant from the World Bank through the National University Commission, Nigeria; Covenant University Center for Research, Innovation, and Discovery (CUCRID), Covenant University; Google TensorFlow College Outreach Award through a machine learning workshop session based on this project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10287938","Blockchain;intrusion detection;deep learning;recurrent neural network","Cloud computing;Intrusion detection;Blockchains;Computational modeling;Security;Monitoring;Servers;Deep learning;Recurrent neural networks","","1","","58","CCBYNCND","19 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The chaotic approach is a critical component of the theoretical framework and can be used in analyzing complex biological structures such as chromatin structures. Fractality is a metric of complexity in biological functions; it is an indicator of the complication level of the self-similar structure, while chaos is a sort of dynamic behavior that usually produces totally arbitrary patterns. Fractal measurements in vivo could be used to predict the efficiency of painful therapy. The fractal technique can be used to assess carcinogenesis, tumor progression, chemoprophylaxis, and treatment with the convergence of modern sensing techniques in nano-scale spectroscopic techniques, which is a prospective biomarker. The mathematical principles of fractals and chaos in biological systems are presented in the context of the condition of health treatment and their significance. Fractality in different biological functions including the heart has now been investigated and measured the dosing quantity with chaos and fractal level. As excessive amounts of chaos and fractal complexity are harmful to biological predictions. For biological applications, chaos analysis may be advantageous.

Meanwhile, key distribution based on physical characteristics provides a new way of thinking. By utilizing the physical attributes of the channel to achieve key distribution, this method not only provides a high degree of security, but also greatly improves convenience. In addition, compared with traditional schemes, deep learning can automatically learn and integrate features at different levels, avoiding complex selection and combination of algorithms, thus possessing stronger generalization and robustness.

We examine student work in an ethics course for senior computer science and software engineering students. The course includes a series of exercises in critical ethical inquiry, implementing the iterative Ethical Cycle approach of van de Poel and Royakkers with reflection sessions where students exchange peer critiques. Through a qualitative analysis of two years of student work, we explore two questions: what kinds of critical issues do students acknowledge in peer dialogue, and how do students incorporate, or fail to incorporate, critical challenges into their work? We identify and categorize critical challenges that appear in student reflection statements, and we identify a number of patterns of critical engagement: ways in which student map the identifications of critical challenges to subsequent changes in later iterations. Our results indicate that dialogue with others is generally an enriching component of students' ethical inquiry, though not all students take advantage of it even when built into class exercises, and other students may adopt new ideas in a superficial way, failing to truly incorporate them into prior discussion. The results also suggest certain design changes of the ethical analysis exercises that can help students take greater advantage of insights from their peers: fostering greater interplay between peers through a single clearly identified topic; more defined scaffolding of peer discussions, prompting students to identify critical challenges from others; further scaffolding to remind students of the peer challenges raised earlier and ask them how (and whether) they wish to incorporate these new perspectives into their own work; and more discussion and modeling of how to truly incorporate new ideas in a robust way.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342929","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342929","computing ethics;reflective practice;peer review;critical thinking","Ethics;Computational modeling;Education;Decision making;Writing;Reflection;Stakeholders","","","","35","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Expanding on this, we will also consider how implementing a new business practice such as a Six Sigma model could affect employee morale. We anticipate that due to a better business environment that something like this could improve, however it will be expanded upon further later in this research paper. Additionally, the last thing we would like to investigate involving Six Sigma in business is how it can change the quality of that business's goods or services. In this paper we will continue to investigate and research the previously stated research topics regarding Six Sigma in business. We will find out whether it is an effective approach and will be using how it affects waste, productivity, morale, and quality, to make an assessment.","2769-5654","979-8-3503-6151-3","10.1109/CSCI62032.2023.00079","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10590568","Six Sigma;business;waste;profits;morale;quality;services;productivity","Productivity;Computer science;Philosophical considerations;Scientific computing;Companies;Computational intelligence;Business","","","","20","IEEE","19 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among various solutions, split manufacturing has received a lot of attention due to its security guarantees. With the recent emergence of new heterogeneous manufacturing technologies, including chiplet-based systems, there is a new opportunity for revisiting the design considerations for split manufacturing to fully exploit the opportunities presented by chiplet-based systems and improve various metrics, such as security, performance, and overhead.This work improves the state-of-the-art in secure chip manufacturing by proposing a new split manufacturing scheme. The key idea is to exploit the capabilities provided by chiplet integration technology for designing a new hybrid split manufacturing scheme that includes both vertical and horizontal splitting. Unlike existing vertical-only split manufacturing mechanisms, that target obfuscation of interconnections by splitting the design at a specific metallization layer into two portions, the proposed hybrid method increases trust by exploiting the chiplet paradigm shift, specifically, breaking the design into sub-designs, each represented by chiplets (independently fabricated), and obfuscating interconnections among them. The proposed obfuscation mechanism targets systems that exploit the chiplet technology to obtain important performance advantages, thus any chiplet-related overhead is not due to obfuscation. We evaluate our method using several experiments and compare it with the state-of-the-art using standard metrics, including area, power, delay, wirelength, and trust. Compared to conventional split manufacturing, our hybrid method achieves up to 245× higher trust, while exhibiting negligible overhead.","","979-8-3503-2348-1","10.1109/DAC56929.2023.10247738","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247738","Hardware security;split manufacturing;chiplet-based integration;Split-Fabric","Measurement;Design automation;Metallization;Hardware;Manufacturing;Delays;Security","","3","","13","IEEE","15 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early prediction of learners’ performance in educational games. In this research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called GameEPM, to estimate learners’ final scores in an educational game for promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach models the sequence of learners’ actions and then uses a limited sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can accurately and robustly estimate the learners’ performance at the early stages of the game. Using less than 50% of learners’ action sequences, the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8%, outperforming a range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R2 gain is achieved in favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial in the deep learning model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3249286","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant funded by the Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1C1C2004868); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10054028","Early performance prediction;learner model;educational games;computational thinking;deep learning","Games;Predictive models;Performance evaluation;Machine learning;Adaptation models;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Education;Learning systems","","1","","41","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Teachers are the controllers of the classroom, and students spend less than 10% of their time speaking English besides being asked to answer questions. Therefore, it is difficult for teachers to become promoters, facilitators, or coordinators of students' learning. Therefore, this article conducts research on the intelligent new mode design through the organic integration of computer networks and EL T (English Language Teaching) courses. When designing teaching activities, we should pursue the mutual promotion between the application of information technology and the transformation of teaching methods. Through the comprehensive application of information technology and various activity methods, information technology can not only support existing teaching methods, but also promote the transformation of teaching methods. Through the analysis of the research results indicating the weekly learning volume of EL T courses, it can be found that only a few students consider it easy, while the majority of students believe that the course volume is large, with an average proportion of up to 52.11 %. It can be seen that students can only engage in effective communication between students and teachers on the basis of self-learning and understanding, and their creative thinking can be effectively improved during the learning process.","","979-8-3503-4159-1","10.1109/ICDSI60108.2023.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10484173","Computer network;English teaching courses;Organic integration;Intelligent New Mode","Technological innovation;Computational modeling;Design methodology;Education;Computer networks;Information technology;Informatics","","","","12","IEEE","2 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Investigating Persuasive Behaviors Across Different Opinion Polarities: A Study of Video Messages","Z.

With the rapid expansion of online communication through social networking websites, more persuasive content is made available online in the form of video. The use of positive and/or negative opinions might affect how persuasive someone appears to be. Persuasiveness is at the core of everyday human-human interactions, such as defending a client in a court, seeking a patient's compliance with medical advice or convincing a customer to buy a product. This study is motivated by the argument that persuasive behavior changes with opinion polarity and whether a speaker is trying to persuade one in favor of or against something. Emotion plays a key role in persuasion both in verbal and non-verbal communication, therefore understanding the impact of opinion polarity (sentiment) on the persuasive messages becomes increasingly important. The study aims to explain the” emotion” behind the message as expressed in negative and positive opinions both persuasive and unpersuasive videos. The data used for the analysis is derived from Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM) dataset which is an online multimodal dataset with existing labels for persuasive and non-persuasive videos placed in two sentiment or opinion polarities (positive and negative). This research paper also introduced a new neuromarketing assessment method called NeuroMap's NeuroScoring tool, previously designed to evaluate persuasive messages through a neuromarketing perspective. The present study results align with the NeuroMap model's emphasis on the role of emotions in persuasion. The persuasion model suggests that emotions directly impact how people process and memorize information and how persuasive messages that evoke positive emotions are more likely to be effective. In the study, sentiment levels can be seen as indicators of emotional content conveyed in the video messages, and the positive relationship between sentiment levels and persuasiveness supports the view that emotional appeal plays a crucial role in influencing persuasion.","","979-8-3503-2759-5","10.1109/CSCE60160.2023.00197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10487429","Persuasive communication;Sentiment analysis;Persuasive Opinion Multimedia (POM);Multimodal Communication","Visualization;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Education;Neuromarketing;Multimedia computing;Streaming media","","","","7","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research postulates a study of machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees and Neural Networks in comparison for the prediction of ASD as well as a novel approach to reduce the computational requirements for the analysis of videos. This research also addresses the lack of publically available video datasets for the analysis of Autism. The highest accuracy metric for the models was using the Neural Network architecture closely followed by the Decision Tree Classifier which yielded accuracies of 99.8% and 99.65% respectively. In this article, we offer an overview of predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder whilst focusing on the importance of video datasets.","","979-8-3503-5268-9","10.1109/IC3IoT60841.2024.10550416","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10550416","Autism Spectrum Disorder;Machine Learning;Youtube Video Datasets;Action Units;Neural Networks","Autism;Logistic regression;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Computer architecture;Predictive models;Feature extraction","","","","24","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Because of the heterogeneity, distribution and dynamics of grid, traditional resource management methods are not suitable for grid environment. In view of the fact that the traditional resource management model can't meet the demand of service grid, this paper studies the resource management model based on the principles of computational economics and the characteristics of service grid environment, and proposes a resource management model based on computational economics. Most of the traditional economic models based on econometrics are linear models. Although such a model is a powerful economic analysis tool, it also has its own defects, that is, it can not reflect a large number of nonlinear relationships in the economic system. In this paper, an artificial neural network is used to establish a national economic forecasting model. In the process of modeling, immune particle swarm optimization algorithm is used to optimize the weights and thresholds of the neural network model, so that the predicted data of the model is closer to the actual data.","","979-8-3503-4303-8","10.1109/ICEDCS60513.2023.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10361777","Neural network;Economic forecast;Particle swarm","Economics;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Economic forecasting;Brain modeling;Data models","","","","13","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

At the same time, the exploration and exploitation of intrinsic musical structures and sequences, a timeless endeavor, continue to captivate scholars and practitioners alike. In this context, the fusion of computational techniques with music analysis emerges as a natural progression. One of the pivotal crossroads in this convergence is the identification of musical phrase boundaries, pivotal demarcations that underpin the organizational fabric of a musical composition. This article pioneers an inventive approach to address the challenge of detecting these musical phrase boundaries, harnessing the power of artificial neural networks. However, the innovation does not stop there; the pinpointed phrase boundaries undergo a comprehensive dissection utilizing pattern mining techniques. The focus of this analysis is on unveiling recurrent motifs and classifying phrases into coherent clusters, predicated on the repetitions and similarities exposed through these neural network-driven techniques. This exploration was conducted using an extensive repository of folk songs, a treasure trove of foundational musical expressions that indelibly shape the stylistic contours of musical compositions. We claim that the presented approach not only opens avenues for penetrating and nuanced analysis, but also enriches our comprehension of the intricate interplay of musical components and their manifestations inspired by neural networks.","2472-8322","978-1-6654-3065-4","10.1109/SSCI52147.2023.10371997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10371997","data mining;neural networks;computational intelligence;music analysis;musical phrases detection","Technological innovation;Data analysis;Shape;Instruments;Music;Rhythm;Fabrics","","","","23","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The relevance of the study is conditioned by the development of artificial intelligence, in which the category of sense plays one of the leading roles. For humans, the concept of sense is relevant, both from a world outlook point of view and from the standpoint of cognitive science. However, the problem lies in the fact that sense is an axiomatic concept and therefore is difficult to formalize. There are various formulations of the sense at a qualitative level, but to solve practical problems in the field of cognitive science, a quantitative definition is required, that is, a description of the sense from a mathematical standpoint. The purpose of the study is to mathematically substantiate the concept of sense using the theory of algorithms and, as a consequence, to prove the possibility of calculating the sense. This paper uses the philosophical concept of the relationship of participation (author S. E. Yachin) and the Kolmogorov Complexity of Algorithms (author A. N. Kolmogorov). The principle of relativization, laid down in the formulation of the relationship of participation, served as the foundation for the development of an algorithmic approach to the calculation of sense. At a hypothetical level, an assumption is made that the additive constant accompanying the algorithmic calculations of information can serve as a measure of the amount of sense. To confirm the proposed hypothesis, a theorem on the computability of sense has been formulated and proved. The results obtained may be of interest to researchers and developers of artificial intelligence and other areas of cognitive science.","","979-8-3503-0797-9","10.1109/CSGB60362.2023.10329809","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10329809","sense;algorithm;artificial intelligence;information;entropy","Additives;Philosophical considerations;Atmospheric measurements;Genomics;Biomedical measurement;Particle measurements;Cognitive science","","","","22","IEEE","4 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional methods of historical inquiry often struggle to captivate learners' interest, particularly in an era dominated by digital experiences. Gamification, incorporating game elements into non-game contexts, has shown promise in fostering engagement and motivation. This study delves into the potential benefits of leveraging immersive gamification to create dynamic and captivating historical exploration experiences. The theoretical framework draws upon educational theories, game design principles, and the evolving landscape of immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality. We examine the limitations of traditional historical education methods and discuss how gamification can address these challenges by providing interactive and participatory learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper outlines fundamental design principles for creating immersive historical exploration scenarios, emphasising the importance of narrative structure, game mechanics, and user engagement. Through case studies, we highlight successful applications of immersive gamification in historical education, presenting outcomes and insights gained from these implementations. Challenges and considerations in integrating immersive gamification into historical exploration are also explored, including ethical considerations and accessibility issues. The paper concludes by proposing future directions for research in this emerging field, anticipating the continued evolution of technologies and pedagogical approaches.","","979-8-3503-5976-3","10.1109/ICERCS57948.2023.10434108","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10434108","Immersive;Virtual Reality;Gamification;Historical Exploration;Open XR","Ethics;Scientific computing;Education;Games;Information age;History;X reality","","","","15","IEEE","21 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the cognitive world, it stimulates thinking capabilities. It prompts a reaction to a particular situation and allows body parts to move. In addition, it also regulates other physiological functions such as digestion and respiration. The nervous system consists of billions of cells which interpret information from sensory elements and translate it into coordinated action performed by various parts of the body. With the increase in age, the steady decline of these cells results in a loss of dopamine compounds. Parkinson's disease (PD) is caused by an unforeseen expansion of the movement of bodily extremities that results in this decline. Finding a cure for this disease is still an enormous challenge, and its progression can be slowed by early detection. The proposed work has been implemented with seven machine learning and deep-learning techniques, including decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), logistic regression, naive Bayes, k nearest neighbour, neural network model, and support vector machines for preemptively predicting PD. The model was implemented utilizing a dataset acquired from Kaggle. This included the normal cases as well as those with PD. The findings showed that the random forest model was superior to others, achieving an accuracy of 86.70%. In contrast, the naive Bayes model displayed the lowest accuracy of 71.50%. In addition, both the random forest and support vector machine models showed the highest accuracy levels of 85.90%. Various other performance metrics such as computational time, AUC (the Area Under the Curve), F1-score, ROC curve area, and recall rate were utilized to predict the effectiveness of each technique. Comparative analysis identified that the least performing models are the k-nearest neighbour and naive Bayes methods. In the future, this method can be refined further by using a large dataset and employing deep learning models for higher predictive outcomes.","","979-8-3503-0644-6","10.1109/ICCICA60014.2024.10585049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10585049","Parkinson’s disease;k-nearest neighbour;machine learning;deep learning;neural networks;random forest;decision tree","Support vector machines;Deep learning;Radio frequency;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Brain modeling","","","","20","IEEE","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By using unstructured pruning and structured pruning methods, the backbone Resnet-18 network model is subjected to local and global lightweight pruning, respectively, where the network structure is optimized to reduce the time and space costs required for micro-expression recognition algorithms.

The DSO is modelled on the rise and fall of homeostatic pressure during the human sleep process. Human sleep is often modelled on the four sleep stages and the deep sleep stage is employed in this work. The mathematical model of sleep homeostatic pressure is employed to simulate and determine the deep sleep state. The performance of DSO is demonstrated by employing 23 traditional functions (i.e., unimodal, multimodal, and fixed multi-modal functions), six composite functions, three engineering design problems, two knapsack problems, and six widely known travelling salesman’s problems. Additionally, the performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational running time, the Wilcoxon rank sum, and the Friedman test.

Researchers are trying to find the best threshold-setting scheme to maximize revenue through quantum computing. This approach not only solves the optimization problem in the field of credit score cards, but also provides a new way of thinking about optimization problems in other fields. In this paper, three traditional computational models, one-fold credit card strategy, two-fold credit card combination strategy, and three-fold credit card combination strategy, are proposed, and the credit score card scheme that maximizes the final revenue is solved for each of the three models. The results show that under the one-fold credit card strategy, the final income is maximized at $54,087.2; under the two-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $41,106.3; and under the three-fold credit card combination strategy, the final income is maximized at $27,914.8.

Recently proposed spatial-temporal forecasting models perform well for short-term traffic forecasting, but two challenges hinder their applications for long-term forecasting in practice. Firstly, existing traffic forecasting models do not have satisfactory scalability on effectiveness and efficiency, i.e., as the prediction time spans extend, existing models either cannot capture the long-term spatial-temporal dynamics of traffic data or equip global receptive fields at the cost of quadratic computational complexity. Secondly, the dilemma between the models’ strong appetite for high-quality training data and their generalization ability is also a challenge we have to face. Thus how to improve data utilization efficiency deserves thoughtful thinking. Aiming at solving the long-term traffic forecasting problem and facilitating the deployment of traffic forecasting models in practice, this paper proposes an efficient and effective Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Bottleneck Attentive Network (SSTBAN). Specifically, SSTBAN follows a multi-task framework by incorporating a self-supervised learner to produce robust latent representations for historical traffic data, so as to improve its generalization performance and robustness for forecasting. Besides, we design a spatial-temporal bottleneck attention mechanism, reducing the computational complexity meanwhile encoding global spatial-temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments on real-world long-term traffic forecasting tasks, including traffic speed forecasting and traffic flow forecasting under nine scenarios, demonstrate that SSTBAN not only achieves the overall best performance but also has good computation efficiency and data utilization efficiency.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00125","Beijing Jiaotong University; China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184658","traffic forecasting;spatial-temporal graph data;self-supervised learning","Computational modeling;Training data;Predictive models;Data models;Robustness;Computational efficiency;Forecasting","","7","","34","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model the planning problem as a probabilistic inference over a factor graph, with factor nodes capturing the joint distribution of motion objectives. By leveraging the duality between optimization and inference, a fast solution to the maximum a posteriori estimation of the factor graph is obtained via least-squares optimization. The localized design thinking inherent in this formulation ensures that motion objectives depend on a small subset of variables. We exploit the locality feature of the factor graph structure to integrate the minimum curvature path and local planning computations into a unified algorithm. This diverges from the conventional separation of global and local planning modules, where curvature minimization occurs at the global level. The evaluation of the proposed framework demonstrated superior performance for cumulative curvature and average speed across the racetrack.

On the other hand, high school students lose interest in certain schools, leading to the discontinuation of specific directions essential for today's job market needs. Institutions largely fail to conduct a comparison and linkage of teaching and non-teaching activities when analyzing the talents and interests of high school students from different fields.

However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.","2159-1288","979-8-3503-8677-6","10.1109/ICCEA62105.2024.10603677","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10603677","large language models;graph problems;graph reasoning;temperature","Temperature sensors;Shortest path problem;Accuracy;Sensitivity;Large language models;Computational modeling;Cognition","","","","15","IEEE","29 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a multidimensional orthogonal fusion module, which orthogonalizes the input feature vectors to obtain pairwise orthogonal vectors, and concatenates the base vectors with the obtained orthogonal vectors to form fusion vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream multimodal emotion recognition algorithms.

With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), combining AI with teachers' ubiquitous learning is a topic of concern. This study discusses the necessity of building a ubiquitous learning model for teachers based on big model technology from three perspectives: the research status on ubiquitous learning and LLMs, policy, and teachers' needs, constructing a framework for LLMs to empower teachers' ubiquitous learning for three major scenarios: teaching, teaching and research, and learning. The LLMs can assist teachers to automate the generation of learning situation analysis, teaching objectives and teaching resources to improve efficiency and teaching quality. In the teaching and research scenarios, the LLMs help to develop training content, evaluate teaching and optimize suggestions to improve the teaching and research. In the learning scenario, the LLMs provide personalized resources, stage summaries and evaluation to promote teachers' professional development. In addition, this study proposes the design idea of generative AI prompts to optimize teachers' learning experience and help them better apply the LLMs for ubiquitous learning. However, here are still some potential challenges and risks in the application of LLMs in education. Therefore, we explored the challenges and risks of teacher’ s collaboration with LLMs and propose responses to them. At the same time, we also prospectively analyzed the iteration and development trends of LLMs technology and explored the potential impact of future technological advances on teachers' pervasive learning and professional development.","","979-8-3503-5180-4","10.1109/CSTE62025.2024.00039","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10589995","Ubiquitous learning;LLMs;teacher information literacy;AIGC","Training;Computer science;Generative AI;Large language models;Computational modeling;Education;Buildings","","","","16","IEEE","18 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Suicide is the third-leading cause of death for college and high school students. Social media allows students in the digital environment to share their suicidal ideas and thoughts with others. Accurate and early detection and prevention of suicidal ideation in students can save the students' lives. To identify the risk factor for suicidal attempts, a suitable method of analysing the suicidal behaviour of students using their sentiment text posted on social media can be used. This paper presents an optimized Dragonfly algorithm (DFA) using a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for the automatic detection of suicidal ideation in students. In our CyberHelp Solution, the proposed DFA-based DBN model analyses student social media data, predicts suicidal behavior, and treats students appropriately. The sentiment analysis performs automated categorization of online messages and makes accurate predictions of the student’s suicidal behaviors. The dragonfly heuristic optimization algorithm is used for tuning the hyperparameter in the deep belief network. The proposed DFA-DBN technique has been implemented to predict suicidal ideation in students with a higher accuracy of 95.5% compared with other classification models.","","978-1-6654-7451-1","10.1109/IDCIoT56793.2023.10053425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10053425","Dragonfly algorithm;Deep Belief Network;Suicidal Ideation;Social media content analysis;Hyperparameter Optimization","Sentiment analysis;Social networking (online);Predictive models;Media;Prediction algorithms;Classification algorithms;Behavioral sciences","","1","","24","IEEE","1 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When learning novel concepts and principles, the learners will try to link and compare the newly learned contents with their existing knowledge system. If the newly learned knowledge matches the built-up ones, the learners will easily merge it into their long-term (permanent) knowledge structure. When the newly learned knowledge does not match their existing structure, the learners feel confused and hard to accept and digest. In many cases, the learners learned similar concepts and principles from middle school to post-college at different levels, in mathematics and engineering mechanics. Learners might notice that some of the concepts and principles at different levels looked similar and plausible, but the critical differences didn't catch enough attention, neither the concepts themselves nor the application conditions. Even though the students heard the explanation from the instructors in the class, it does not match their existing daily life experience, which makes it harder to accept and merge it into their knowledge system. In other words, a puzzle piece was put in the blank position where it does not fit. The present study is working on rebuilding the STEM knowledge structures and exploring the differences that existed among high school students (9th- 12th graders), first-year engineering undergraduates, higher-level engineering students, and professional engineers with designed quantitative and qualitative research methods. This research aims to explore the possibility of making the transition smoother from one learning stage to another and develop a novel curriculum that could merge the knowledge structures in a new way to reduce or eliminate the gaps between different levels of STEM learning. The author of the present project was working with 9th-12th grade students from local high schools, and college students in STEM majors at a public university, to rebuild and figure out the differences in their knowledge structures for STEM learning. The project includes preparation work as the development of concept inventories in STEM fields, structured survey questionnaires for both experimental groups. The topics the author chose are concepts shared and inherited from high school STEM education, such as force, velocity, acceleration, Newton's Second Law, etc. Currently, the study focused on the feedback of their scores completing the concept inventories, while the next phase of intervention will be applied.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343236","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343236","knowledge structure;multi strata;STEM Education","Surveys;Knowledge engineering;Knowledge based systems;Force;Mathematics;Engineering students;STEM","","","","24","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Higher education has long taken advantage of the opportunities offered by digitisation, which greatly facilitates the lives of individuals involved in education. It is an effective and good solution for the educators, but it is also an equally effective and good solution for the learners.

To disrupt this enduring lineage and integrally reorient technology innovation toward ecological balance, four targeted strategies are proposed: (1) adopting question-seeking and systems thinking; (2) designing integrated ecosystems rather than discrete networks; (3) balancing exploitation with exploration; and (4) infusing diverse perspectives through transdisciplinarity.

This ambiguity is foundational to computer science and has its roots in the response of university computer centers to the commercialization of computing in the mid-1950s. University computing experts developed an understanding of the activity of computing disentangled from the computer itself, a conceptual shift that went together with a parallel process of dematerialization of the notion of computer. These transformations were facilitated by the ascendance of a high modernist agenda in the sciences in the United States. University computing experts embraced the high modernist agenda and developed analogies across programs, notations, and a notion of the computer now understood as a model of computation. This immaterial conflation of notations, programs, and representations of the machine, would become one of the core tenets of computer science.","1934-1547","","10.1109/MAHC.2023.3266359","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10106116","Computer science;computer programming;programming languages;high modernism;abstraction","Programming;History;Computational modeling;Computer languages;Writing;Switches;Software","","","","97","IEEE","20 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) technology has emerged in response to this challenge. This technique combines complementary information from multiple partially focused images to generate an all-in-focus fused image. The fully clear image is the foundation of subsequent visual tasks. However, existing methods rarely focus on the fusion of image sequence, even though image sequence are more common in practical scenarios. In this paper, we have proposed a novel MFIF generative model based on transformer encoder, termed as SPAFusion. We think that MFIF should focus on patches from the same regions within the source images. Therefore, the attention mechanism of our model is based on patches. We further introduce a shift patch mechanism to integrate long-range dependencies. Benefit from the patch attention and shift patch mechanisms, our model boasts a significantly reduced parameter count and computational complexity compared to existing transformer-based MFIF models. Additionally, the introduction of the shift patch mechanism enables the model to integrate long-range dependencies, allowing it to incorporate both intra-domain and cross-domain contextual information. Finally, we employ pooling to obtain the fused image, enabling our model to support the fusion of image sequence. Experiments show the superiority of our SPAFusion compared to the state-of-the-art MFIF models.","2161-4407","979-8-3503-5931-2","10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650372","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10650372","Multi-Focus;Image Fusion;Transformer;Patch Attention;Shift Patch","Analytical models;Visualization;Computational modeling;Transformers;Image sequences;Task analysis;Computational complexity","","","","33","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this vein, we consider the partial computation offloading problem in the metaverse for multiple subtasks in a COIN environment to minimize energy consumption and delay while dynamically adjusting the offloading policy based on the changing computational resource status. The problem is NP-hard, and we transform it into two subproblems: the task-splitting problem (TSP) on the user side and the task-offloading problem (TOP) on the COIN side. We model the TSP as an ordinal potential game and propose a decentralized algorithm to obtain its Nash equilibrium (NE). Then, we model the TOP as a Markov decision process and propose the double deep Q-network (DDQN) to solve for the optimal offloading policy. Unlike the conventional DDQN algorithm, where intelligent agents sample offloading decisions randomly within a certain probability, the COIN agent explores the NE of the TSP and the deep neural network. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the proposed model approach allows the COIN agent to update its policies and make more informed decisions, leading to improved performance over time compared to the traditional baseline.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3344817","Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI); Korean Government (“A Study of Hyper-Connected Thinking Internet Technology by Autonomous Connecting, Controlling and Evolving Ways”)(grant numbers:23ZR1110); Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation (IITP); Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)] through the Artificial Intelligence Innovation Hub(grant numbers:2021-0-02068); National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Korean Government (MSIT)(grant numbers:2021R1I1A3060565); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10366259","Computational offloading;deep reinforcement learning;game theory;in-network computing;metaverse","Task analysis;Metaverse;Resource management;X reality;Dynamic scheduling;Delays;Optimization","","","","51","CCBYNCND","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the capability of VLMs to “think” from a first-person perspective, a crucial attribute for advancing autonomous agents and robotics, remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, we introduce EgoThink, a novel visual question-answering benchmark that encompasses six core capabilities with twelve detailed dimensions. The benchmark is constructed using selected clips from ego-centric videos, with manually annotated question-answer pairs containing first-person information. To comprehensively assess VLMs, we evaluate twenty-one popular VLMs on EgoThink. Moreover, given the open-ended format of the answers, we use GPT-4 as the automatic judge to compute single-answer grading. Experimental results indicate that although GPT-4V leads in numerous dimensions, all evaluated VLMs still possess considerable potential for improvement in first-person perspective tasks. Meanwhile, enlarging the number of trainable parameters has the most significant impact on model performance on EgoThink. In conclusion, EgoThink serves as a valuable addition to existing evaluation benchmarks for VLMs, providing an indispensable resource for future research in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence and robotics.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-5300-6","10.1109/CVPR52733.2024.01355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654818","Egocentric;Vision-Language Models;Benchmark","Bridges;Visualization;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Focusing;Benchmark testing;Planning","","","","91","IEEE","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In 1864 Clerk Maxwell used an equation to show that an electromagnetic wave would be propagated through space at the speed of light. The chapter considers the efforts to create a mathematical model of aerodynamics.","","9781119885665","10.1002/9781119885689.ch3","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9893006.pdf&bkn=9892677&pdfType=chapter","","Moon;Sun;Earth;Planetary orbits;Computational modeling;Extraterrestrial measurements;Analytical models","","","","","","14 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","Wiley-IEEE Press eBook Chapters"

Complete exploration of all valid configurations (the configuration space) is infeasible as it grows exponentially with the number of features in the worst case. In practice, few representative configurations are sampled instead, which may be used for software testing or hardware verification. Pseudo-randomness of modern computers introduces statistical bias into these samples. Quantum computing enables truly random, uniform configuration sampling based on inherently random quantum physical effects. We propose a method to encode the entire configuration space in a superposition and then measure one random sample. We show the method's uniformity over multiple samples and investigate its scale for different feature models. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of quantum computing for uniform random sampling regarding current and future quantum hardware.","","979-8-3503-0180-9","10.1109/Q-SE59154.2023.00012","German Federal Ministry(grant numbers:01MQ22006F); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10189158","Uniform sampling;Software product lines;Quantum computing","Computers;Software testing;Quantum computing;Quantum algorithm;Computational modeling;Scalability;Quantum mechanics","","1","","30","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Future engineers will need to apply modeling to solve problems that emerge in professional activities building on the school primary engineering learning. The construction of physical processes 3D models in computer environments can aid in the development of engineering thinking and digital training. This requires the electronic educational resources design and the development of suitable methods. The collaboration between pedagogical and engineering universities can facilitate the accomplishment of these tasks provided with methodical basis and a consolidation of the universities scientific and practical developments in the network interaction. One of the popular areas for training future engineers is distance project design where tasks are distributed among several performers. The issue of interdisciplinary design of electronic educational resources to ensure the quality of engineering training in technological profiles in schools is significant for the theory and practice of innovation in engineering education, pedagogical methodology and technology, and digital didactics. The proposed methods include computer modeling of physical processes in engineering (using materials science example), pedagogical design, and educational outcomes analysis. The paper describes the results of experimental work on organizing interdisciplinary projects for the development of electronic educational resources for school engineering learning by student teams. These teams consist of pedagogical university students, future teachers, and polytechnic university students, future engineers. It concludes that interdisciplinary training of students from pedagogical and engineering universities in the electronic educational resources design on computer modeling for school primary engineering learning is effectively feasible using distributed educational technologies. The outcome may be useful for early schoolchildren involvement in innovative engineering initiatives through participation in research projects and STEM Olympiads including multi-language educational events.","","979-8-3503-7136-9","10.1109/Inforino60363.2024.10552015","Ministry of Education; Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Russian Federation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552015","interdisciplinary design;electronic educational resources;school education;primary engineering learning;computer modeling;pedagogical universities;engineering universities;distance technologies;student teams projects","Training;Solid modeling;Materials science and technology;Three-dimensional displays;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Educational technology","","","","23","IEEE","13 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These LiCRPs aim at suggesting DMs to change their original opinions to increase the group consensus degree, computed by a certain consensus measure. In recent years, these LiCRPs have been a prolific research line, and consequently, numerous proposals have been introduced in the specialized literature. However, we have pointed out the nonexistence of objective metrics to compare these models and decide which one presents the best performance for each LiGDM problem. Therefore, this article aims at introducing a metric to evaluate the performance of LiCRPs that takes into account the resulting consensus degree and the cost of modifying DMs' initial opinions. Such a metric is based on a linguistic comprehensive minimum cost consensus (CMCC) model based on Extended Comparative Linguistic Expressions with Symbolic Translation information that models DMs' hesitancy and provides accurate Computing with Words processes.

In the field of robotics, however, relevant research focuses mostly on the generation of fully-actuated open chain kinematics, which is trivial in mechanical engineering perspective. Within this paper, we address the problem of generative design of closed-chain linkage mechanisms. A GD algorithm has to be able to generate meaningful mechanisms which satisfy conditions of existence. We propose an optimization-driven algorithm for generation of planar closed-chain linkages to follow a predefined trajectory. The algorithm creates an unlimited range of physically reproducible design alternatives that can be further tested in simulation. These tests could be done in order to find solutions that satisfy extra criteria, e.g., desired dynamic behavior or low energy consumption. The proposed algorithm is called “respawn” since it builds a new linkage after the ancestor has been tested in a virtual environment in pursuit for the optimal solution. To show that the algorithm is general enough, we show a set of generated linkages that can be used for a wide class of robots.","2153-0866","978-1-6654-9190-7","10.1109/IROS55552.2023.10341425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10341425","","Couplings;Heuristic algorithms;Software algorithms;Virtual environments;Transforms;Software;Trajectory","","1","","20","IEEE","13 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, we analyze the current status of the GBA field by performing the first systematic literature review on empirical GBA studies. It is based on 65 research papers that used digital GBAs to determine: the context where the study has been applied, the primary purpose, the domain of the game used, game/tool availability, the size of the data sample, the computational methods and algorithms applied, the targeted stakeholders of the study, and what limitations and challenges are reported by authors. Based on the categories established and our analysis, the findings suggest that GBAs are mainly used in K-16 education and for assessment purposes, and that most GBAs focus on assessing STEM content, and cognitive and soft skills. Furthermore, the current limitations indicate that future GBA research would benefit from the use of bigger data samples and more specialized algorithms.

This study explores how graduate teaching candidates and undergraduate pre-service teachers engage with Math+CS modules differently. We were interested in the similarities and differences in the way senior-level pre-service teachers in a mathematics and technology class and graduate-level teacher candidates in a methods class interact with Math+CS integrated modules. Working with the concepts of variable, input, and output, we investigated which knowledge domains were leveraged among groups in different classes, what connections they make between the concepts in math and CS, and their uncertainty. The results indicated that there was a difference in the way the teaching candidates in their methods class approached the computational modules than the pre-service teachers. The pre-service teachers focused more on developing their CS content knowledge, and the teacher candidates were interested in making connections between their knowledge domains, reflecting on how their students would think about the concepts in math, expressing more concerns, and asking more questions to develop their TPACK.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343081","Computer science;computational thinking;K-12;teachers;integrated curriculum;mathematics;teacher development;Math + CS","Computer science;Uncertainty;Education;Government;Mathematics","","","","40","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our work, not only achieves state-of-the-art performance, but more importantly offers the community a roadmap to explore solutions for ICAA.

The authors of PoL forego cryptographic approaches and trade rigorous security guarantees for scalability to deep learning. They empirically argued the benefit of this approach by showing how spoofing—computing a proof for a stolen model—is as expensive as obtaining the proof honestly by training the model. However, recent work has provided a counter-example and thus has invalidated this observation.In this work we demonstrate, first, that while it is true that current PoL verification is not robust to adversaries, recent work has largely underestimated this lack of robustness. This is because existing spoofing strategies are either unreproducible or target weakened instantiations of PoL—meaning they are easily thwarted by changing hyperparameters of the verification. Instead, we introduce the first spoofing strategies that can be reproduced across different configurations of the PoL verification and can be done for a fraction of the cost of previous spoofing strategies. This is possible because we identify key vulnerabilities of PoL and systematically analyze the underlying assumptions needed for robust verification of a proof. On the theoretical side, we show how realizing these assumptions reduces to open problems in learning theory. We conclude that one cannot develop a provably robust PoL verification mechanism without further understanding of optimization in deep learning.","","978-1-6654-6512-0","10.1109/EuroSP57164.2023.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190491","","Training;Deep learning;Protocols;Costs;Computational modeling;Scalability;Artificial neural networks","","1","","23","IEEE","31 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, the rapid identification of RNA-protein binding sites is crucial for functional annotation and site-directed mutagenesis. In this work, a new parallel network that integrates the multi-head attention mechanism and the expectation pooling is proposed, named MAHyNet. The left-branch network of MAHyNet hybrids convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent neural network (GRU) to extract the features of one-hot. The right-branch network is a two-layer CNN network to analyze physicochemical properties of RNA base. Specifically, the multi-head attention mechanism is a computational collection of multiple independent layers of attention, which can extract feature information from multiple dimensions. The expectation pooling combines probabilistic thinking with global pooling. This approach helps to reduce model parameters and enhance the model performance. The combination of CNN and GRU enables further extraction of high-level features in sequences. In addition, the study shows that appropriate hyperparameters have a positive impact on the model performance. Physicochemical properties can be used to supplement characterization information to improving model performance.

The incorporation of LLMs should be defined not only by pedagogues and educational institutions, but also by students who will actively utilize them to learn and prepare assignments. In order to find out what students from two universities think and suggest about LLMs use in education, they were asked to give their contribution by answering the survey that was conducted at the beginning of the spring semester of academic 2022/23. Their feedback was quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed, showing in a better light what students think about LLMs and how and why they would use them. Based on the analysis, the authors propose an original strategy for integrating LLMs into education. The proposed approach is also adapted for those students who are not interested in using LLMs and for those who prefer the hybrid mode by combining their own research with LLMs generated recommendations.

We introduce our flagship product, i.e., the Cloudblazer i20 accelerator, which integrates the innovated Deep Thinking Unit (DTU 2.0). The design is driven by requests drawn from various AI inference applications and insights learned from our previous products. With careful tradeoffs in hardware-software co-design, Cloudblazer i20 delivers impressive performance and energy efficiency while maintaining acceptable hardware costs and software complexity/flexibility. To tackle computation- and data-intensive workloads, DTU 2.0 integrates powerful vector/matrix engines and a large-capacity multi-level memory hierarchy with high bandwidth. It supports comprehensive data flow and synchronization patterns to fully exploit parallelism in computation/memory access within or among concurrent tasks. Moreover, it enables sparse data compression/decompression, data broadcasting, repeated data transfer, and kernel code prefetching to optimize bandwidth utilization and reduce data access overheads. To utilize the underlying hardware and simplify the development of customized DNNs/operators, the software stack enables automatic optimizations (such as operator fusion and data flow tuning) and provides diverse programming interfaces for developers. Lastly, the energy consumption is optimized through dynamic power integrity and efficiency management, eliminating integrity risks and energy wastes. Based on the performance requirement, developers also can assign their workloads with the entire or partial hardware resources accordingly.

Time perspectives (TPs) have attracted increasing attention in recent years in that making use of TPs can help gain insights into the real motives behind suicide ideation. TPs take into consideration how people think of or appraise their past, present, or future life would shape their behavior. Conventional TP-oriented studies on suicide tendency detection tend to rely on questionnaire surveys to help identify suicide thoughts or attempts. Such efforts suffer from weaknesses including low data collection efficiency and self-report bias. We proposed a TP-enhanced deep multitask model, TP-GloVe-GRU, in which TP is regarded as the synergy of both time and emotions. The model performance was evaluated against the CEASE dataset using a range of metrics. Results show that incorporating TP into the detection of suicide ideation leads to a better performance in most cases with an increase of 2.27% in the accuracy of suicide risk assessment.","","979-8-3503-1980-4","10.1109/SWC57546.2023.10448961","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10448961","suicide note;time perspective;GRU;GloVe","Surveys;Shape;Computational modeling;Text categorization;Moon;Multitasking;Risk management","","1","","35","IEEE","1 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these issues, we develop an unsupervised machine learning method to characterize the bias of cable news programs without any human input. This method relies on the analysis of what topics are mentioned through Named Entity Recognition and how those topics are discussed through Stance Analysis in order to cluster programs with similar biases together. Applying our method to 2020 cable news transcripts, we find that cable news programs tend to cluster together consistently over time and roughly correspond to the cable news network of the program.

However, introducing programming at such an early stage presents unique challenges, given the need for students to grasp mathematical concepts, abstract thinking, and the intricacies of programming syntax. Educational Data Mining (EDM) offers a potential contribution by predicting learning performance, facilitating the optimization of the learning processes, and providing real-time guidance. A notable gap in the current literature about EDM in programming education is its predominant emphasis on the university level. Our research objectives were to identify features influencing primary school students' programming capabilities. A more comprehensive dataset was introduced, incorporating psychometric data and highlighting features such as learning motivation and attitude, computational thinking data, and other potentially influential variables, which set our study apart from previous studies. We found that the strongest predictor was academic performance in Information Technology, followed by psychometric data on students' learning attitudes and motivation. Computational thinking also emerged as a significant feature in predicting programming performance. It's worth highlighting that involvement in extra-curricular activities, like Olympic Mathematics training, showed a significant association, underscoring the importance of mathematical logic and reasoning in programming. This is further bolstered by the evident correlation with academic performance in Mathematics, confirming its pivotal role in shaping programming abilities. Interestingly, the correlation of academic performance in Chinese is also significant, indicating that the language medium of instruction can notably influence success.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578608","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578608","Computer science;Programming Education;Educational Data Mining;Educational features correlation;Performance prediction;Features selection","Training;Performance evaluation;Computers;Correlation;Syntactics;Mathematics;Cognition","","","","31","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unlike theory of emotion, which has been the historical focus in psychology, emotion models are a descriptive tool. In practice, the strongest models need robust coverage, which means defining the smallest core set of emotions from which all others can be derived. To achieve the desired coverage, we turn to word embeddings from natural language processing. Using unsupervised clustering techniques, our experiments show that with as few as 15 discrete emotion categories, we can provide maximum coverage across six major languages–Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Spanish, and Russian. In support of our findings, we also examine annotations from two large-scale emotion recognition datasets to assess the validity of existing emotion models compared to human perception at scale.

Previous DRL compression strategies predominantly focused on unstructured pruning, effective for reducing model size but requiring specialized hardware for computational acceleration. Conversely, DRL models with structured pruning applied can be accelerated on standard hardware, though they typically encounter performance issues at higher pruning rates due to structural constraints. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces an advanced structured pruning methodology, combined with scaled policy constraints (SPC) for DRL models. Our approach overcomes the performance limitations of conventional structured pruning, achieving high pruning rates while maintaining robust model performance. Enhanced performance restoration after pruning is achieved by fine-tuning with SPC and applying structural regularization, thus ensuring efficient decision-making with a minimal computational burden. Extensive evaluations on the D4RL benchmark and in a drone control simulation environment confirm the effectiveness of our method. Our approach maintains performance integrity even at high pruning rates, with less than a 2% decrease in normalized score at 90% pruning in D4RL and preserving cumulative reward at 87% pruning in drone control simulation. Significantly, our approach also enables considerable computational acceleration on standard hardware. We implemented our method on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX board and achieved a 2.5-fold speed-up on devices with NVIDIA Volta GPUs and over double the speed-up on those with NVIDIA Carmel ARMv8.2 CPUs. These outcomes highlight our method’s suitability for real-time, resource-constrained applications, demonstrating its practicality and efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3367002","Korean government(grant numbers:23ZR1100); A Study of Hyper-Connected Thinking Internet Technology by autonomous connecting, controlling, and evolving ways) and the research fund of Hanyang University(grant numbers:HY-201900000002966); Development of Ultra-Low Power Deep Learning Processor Technology using Advanced Data Reuse for Edge Applications(grant numbers:2020-0-01297); Ministry of Science and ICT(grant numbers:2020M3H2A1076786); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10439169","Deep reinforcement learning;offline reinforcement learning;model compression;structured pruning;fine-tuning;robotics;autonomous driving;drone control;D4RL","Computational modeling;Reinforcement learning;Decision making;Cloning;Behavioral sciences;Hardware;Data models;Deep reinforcement learning;Robots;Drones;Mobile robots","","","","43","CCBYNCND","19 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Owing to its outstanding interpretability and strong nonlinear representation capability, the Takagi–Sugeno (T–S) fuzzy model is employed to represent the nonlinear HiTL control system and approximate the unknown human control law based on the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme. A quadratic-like cost function with fuzzy weighting matrices is built to depict the human behavior, which conforms to human thinking and is unknown to the machine. The aim of the HBL is to retrieve the fuzzy weighting matrices such that the human control law will be optimal in the sense of minimizing the retrieved cost function. In the proposed HBL scheme, the state-dependent Riccati equation-based nonlinear optimal control technique plays an important role, which has a similar structure to the linear quadratic regulator theory and thus is of low computational complexity. With the help of the PDC-based fuzzy approximator for the unknown human control law, a two-step procedure is proposed for the HBL. First, a filter-based adaptive law is developed to learn the gain matrices of the fuzzy approximator using the system state data only. The convergence analysis of the adaptive estimator is also given.

Sufficient medical data are one of the most critical factors in CAD research. However, medical data are usually obtained in chronological order and cannot be collected all at once, which poses difficulties for the application of deep learning technology in the medical field. The traditional batch learning method consumes considerable time and space resources for real-time medical data, and the incremental learning method often leads to catastrophic forgetting. To solve these problems, we propose a real-time medical data processing method based on federated learning. We divide the process into the model stage and the exemplar stage. In the model stage, we use the federated learning method to fuse the old and new models to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. In the exemplar stage, we use the most representative exemplars selected from the old data to help the new model review the old knowledge, which further mitigates the catastrophic forgetting problem of the new model. We use this method to conduct experiments on a simulated medical real-time data stream. The experimental results show that our method can learn a disease diagnosis model from a continuous medical real-time data stream. As the amount of data increases, the performance of the disease diagnosis model continues to improve, and the catastrophic forgetting problem has been effectively mitigated. Compared with the traditional batch learning method, our method can significantly save time and space resources.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2022.3185395","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076255); Science and Technology Program of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2020SK2059); National Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2019JJ20025,2019JJ40406,2022JJ30424); National Social Science Fund of China(grant numbers:20&ZD120); Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Lab(grant numbers:2022RC0AB07); Key projects of Hunan Education Department(grant numbers:20A88); Scientific Research Project of Hunan Provincial Depart-ment of Education(grant numbers:21B0616); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9804805","Computer-aided diagnosis;medical real-time data;incremental learning;federated learning","Medical diagnostic imaging;Data models;Solid modeling;Real-time systems;Medical diagnosis;Learning systems;Collaborative work","Humans;Deep Learning;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Algorithms;Databases, Factual","26","","45","IEEE","23 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Overcoming these problems demands creative approaches and enhanced procedures that can capture the changing character of cognitive growth. The goal of this framework is to improve the accuracy and sensitivity of cognitive neuroscience studies, leading to a deeper comprehension of the complex mechanisms at play during brain development. In this study, there is a method called functional magnetic resonance-based tensor imaging (FMR-TI) that combines the strengths of both methods to provide more precise mapping of cognitive growth throughout time. As a bonus, the suggested method uses simulation analyses to verify its efficiency and resilience in capturing the nuances of cognitive development, making the results of the study more trustworthy.

There is little research on discussion-assistance systems to monitor and control the state of diversity and cohesion of opinions. This study proposes a system that guides participants to concentrate on differences in their opinions and to reach a decision with more satisfied agreement by encouraging cognitive empathy (i.e., understanding others’ thoughts). The system evaluates the similarity of opinions among participants, then it provides feedback on the similarity score to them. Receiving the feedback, participants can determine the necessity of the exchange of opinions to converge the discussion (not debate). We prepared a team-building task in which two participants alternately presented their opinions based on individual thoughts and emotions; then, they checked the similarity between their opinions and discussed cooperatively them to reach an agreement. We show that the feedback of opinion similarity score increases cognitive empathy, which is also objectively validated by observation of brain activities. Particularly, we observed the strong phase-synchronicity of theta wave between the discussion participants’ left lateral prefrontal cortexes. Satisfaction of participants with the result of the discussion marginally increased and the similarity score of their opinions significantly increased along with the task process. In conclusion, the feedback system during the team task promoted positively the consideration of their own and their partner’s emotions and thoughts.

With the emergence of smartphones in the 2010s, the notion of portable 2D graphical user interfaces was born, and by today, users accessing digital services are no longer tethered to a single location. All of these advances have led to immense changes in our conceptualization of digital information systems, the effects of which are difficult to overestimate. Recent developments in virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR), as well as in Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) are poised to lead to the next major breakthrough in this series of cognitive expansions, bringing to the forefront portable, context-aware spatial interfaces. A consequence of these developments is that users are expecting to be able to access a growing multitude and variety of digital content in ways that are increasingly contextualized and personalized, i.e., relevant to the time, location and topic from the perspective of the users’ personal history. In this paper, we propose an adaptive content labeling and storage model that is suitable to these challenges.

We leveraged motherboards to address uncertainty through sketching and aesthetic intuition, refining options and ultimately selecting an optimal design. In the evaluation phase, we initially constructed a parametric 3D model with 20 parameters based on the optimal design, and invited 32 designers conducting participatory design experiments, getting 1024 human-designed schemes. Following this, we administered an online survey to assess the aesthetic qualities of a total of 1024 design schemes.

This trend may have been going on for longer than we think, with many companies seemingly changing focus at some point. Nevertheless, what are the benefits of device and product repair? Why not just throw out the broken product and buy a new one? In this paper, we will give a history of the right to repair and discuss how long the anti-repair engineering trend has gone on. We will also go into the potential costs and benefits of engineering with the right to repair in mind and the expenses that come with the current way companies operate. In the end, this paper should inform how, as a whole, the greater world could benefit from right to repair legislation and design.

Knowledge map is a giant semantic network composed of nodes and edges, which represents the semantic association between different nodes in the form of large-scale graph. Knowledge map, as a structured storage form of multi-domain data in the real world, provides semantic relevance between data and makes it possible for artificial intelligence to make better use of data. The research of representation learning based on knowledge map realizes the distributed representation of entities and relationships, significantly improves the computational efficiency, effectively alleviates the problem of data sparseness and can realize the fusion of heterogeneous information, which is of great significance for people to obtain effective information from massive data. In view of the above situation, taking WebQA data set as an example, this paper proposes a method to simplify the original text, introduce apriori knowledge related to answers from the knowledge map, and use neural network model to generate Chinese questions.

Despite the criticisms of an ‘intelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth’, ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of ‘standard’ chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting (‘standard’) chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.

Metamorphic testing (MT) can alleviate this problem by checking the consistency of the system’s outputs under various transformations. However, manual generation of MRs is often a time-consuming and error-prone process. Automated MR generation can yield several benefits, including enhanced efficiency, quality, coverage, scalability, and reusability in software testing, thereby facilitating a more comprehensive and effective testing process. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT for automatic generation of MRs for ADSs. We provide a detailed methodology for generating MRs using ChatGPT and evaluate the generated MRs using our domain knowledge and existing MRs. The results of our study indicate that our proposed approach is effective at generating high-quality MRs, and can significantly reduce the manual effort required for MR generation.

In literature, models exist that can read ear tags; however, they are not easily portable to real-world cattle production environments and make predictions mainly on still images. We propose a video-based cattle ear tag reading system, called ReadMyCow, which takes advantage of the temporal characteristics in videos to accurately detect, track, and read cattle ear tags at 25 FPS on edge devices. For each frame in a video, ReadMyCow functions in two steps. 1) Tag detection: a YOLOv5s Object Detection model and NVIDIA Deepstream Tracking Layer detect and track the tags present. 2) Tag reading: the novel WhenToRead module decides whether to read each tag, using a TRBA Scene Text Recognition model, or to use the reading from a previous frame. The system is implemented on an edge device, namely the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin or Xavier, making it portable to cattle production environments without external computational resources. To attain real-time speeds, ReadMyCow only reads the detected tag in the current frame if it thinks it will get a better reading when a decision metric is significantly improved in the current frame. Ideally, this means the best reading of a tag is found and stored throughout a tag’s presence in the video, even when the tag becomes occluded or blurry. While testing the system at a real Midwestern dairy farm housing 9,000 cows, 96.1% of printed ear tags were accurately read by the ReadMyCow system, demonstrating its real-world commercial potential. ReadMyCow opens opportunities for informed data-driven decision-making processes on commercial cattle farms.","2642-9381","979-8-3503-1892-0","10.1109/WACV57701.2024.00690","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10484127","Applications;Agriculture;Applications;Animals / Insects","Productivity;Computer vision;Image edge detection;Computational modeling;Decision making;Ear;Cows","","1","","54","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This trend can be attributed to the pervasive presence of robots in many environments, such as homes, offices, museums, and hospitals, that require more empathic and reliable human-machine relationships. Recent studies demonstrated that providing the robot with the ability to think aloud improves humans’ trust in machines, as they can understand the underlying reasoning of the artifact, what conclusions it can draw, and why and how. This work integrates a robot’s inner speech mechanism with Damasio’s theory of emotions to make the robot functionally conscious of its emotional experience, leading to a computational model of Extended Consciousness, SUSAN (Self-dialogue Utility in Simulating Artificial Emotions). Damasio claims that emotions originate within the body and precede and influence the reasoning processes that make the person aware of them. According to his theory, Extended Consciousness refers to the humans’ cognitive processes that make the humans themselves aware of the physiological experiences of emotions purged by an external stimulus. SUSAN models the bodily emotional experience and simulates the awareness of the emergent emotion by using inner speech. The model is presented, and the initial results related to a use case are discussed.","","979-8-3503-2745-8","10.1109/ACIIW59127.2023.10388201","Air Force Office of Scientific Research; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10388201","Inner Speech;Theory of emotions;Damasio;Consciousness;Robot;Artificial Intelligence","Hospitals;Cognitive processes;Computational modeling;Human-machine systems;Conferences;Reliability theory;Market research","","","","36","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, existing research on emotion recognition is mostly focused on recognizing the emotions of speakers across complete modalities. In real-world situations, emotion reasoning is an interesting field for inferring human emotions from a person’s surroundings when neither the face nor voice can be observed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel multimodal approach for predicting emotion from missing one or more modalities based on attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ self-attention for each unimodal representation to extract the dominant features and utilize the compounded paired-modality attention (CPMA) among sets of modalities to identify the context of the considered individual, such as the interplay of modalities, and capture people’s interactions in the video. The proposed model is trained on the Multimodal Emotion Reasoning (MEmoR) dataset, which includes multimedia inputs such as visual, audio, text, and personality. The proposed model achieves a weighted F1-score of 50.63% for the primary emotion group and 42.7% for the fine-grained one.

This limitation has sparked the need for an effective prompt optimization method to generate optimized text prompts automatically for text-to-image generative models. Thus, this study proposes a prompt optimization method that uses in-context few-shot learning in a pretrained language model. The proposed approach aims to generate optimized text prompts to guide the image synthesis process by leveraging the available contextual information in a few text examples. The results revealed that synthesized images using the proposed prompt optimization method achieved a higher performance, at 18% on average, based on an evaluation metric that measures the similarity between the generated images and prompts for generation.

We characterize the EI using a classical mathematical method while considering the power density, the SAR, the electric field strength, and the tissue's density and conductivity. As such, a novel exposure-index open-loop power control algorithm is proposed to evaluate the realistic RF-EMF radiation exposure on human users from both the downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) communication devices. To solve an EI minimization problem using the open-loop power control algorithm, we formulate it in the form of a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. As the energy capacity (i.e., power density) in wireless networks determines the radiation exposure (SAR and EI), it minimizes the EI by controlling and managing the transmitted and received powers under the restrictions of Quality of Service (QoS), interference, and power, while ensuring the users' QoS requirements are met. Our proposed scheme is numerically compared to other heuristic algorithms and exposure limits established by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) and other similar organizations. Lastly, we compare the emissions from 4G and 5G networks to the emissions from UL and DL transmissions. Our simulation findings indicate that our proposed technique is a good alternative.

However, when more than one learning agents are present, developing efficient collaborations/interactions is a challenging issue; not every agent may have access to the same amount of information and computational resources; not every agent may make the same assumptions about the decision-making mechanisms of one another; and many agents may not even be aware of the existence of other agents. These cognitive and physical limitations can be seen as a form of bounded rationality. Several recent experimental and empirical studies have found that the initial responses of decision-makers in multi-player games are often far from the equilibrium, which is very often out-predicted by structural non-equilibrium (e.g., cognitive hierarchy) models. This is because non-equilibrium play models allow for players who are boundedly rational and have limited information, so that their policy is not necessarily a best response to the actual adjustment laws of other agents. This tutorial talk will present computationally and communicationally efficient approaches for decision-making in boundedly rational stochastic games. Motivated by the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose non-equilibrium strategies, two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning will be described. In the first model, named level-k thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs, and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, this tutorial talk will present both a level-recursive as well as a level-paralleled algorithm, where the latter can have an overall reduced computational complexity.

Recent studies have shown that the readily available data, dispersed over many online life phases, contains useful clues for accurately identifying persons with suicidal intentions. The primary challenge in preventing suicide is learning to recognize and respond appropriately to the sometimes-confusing risk factors and warning indications that may precipitate an attempt. Indicators useful for diagnosing people with suicide thoughts can be found in publicly available material shared over social media platforms, according to recent studies. Understanding and recognizing the myriad risk factors and warning symptoms that may precede a suicide attempt is the primary difficulty in this area of public health. In this research, we developed a benchmark for multi-class categorization using machine learning models. We used a majority classifier, a frequency-based technique, and two deep learning models as our models. Both deep learning models outperformed the majority and the word frequency classifier, with results that were very comparable. These classification results are on par with the state-of-the-art on similar problems and, in most cases, with human results.","","979-8-3503-1590-5","10.1109/ACCAI58221.2023.10201110","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10201110","Twitter;Tweets;Suicidal note;Deep Learning Model;Support Vector Machine","Deep learning;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Blogs;Support vector machine classification;Learning (artificial intelligence);Benchmark testing","","8","","12","IEEE","4 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the computing education context, these models are being used to generate code, code explanations, and programming exercises. The rapid adoption of these models has prompted multiple position papers and workshops which discuss the implications of these models for computing education, both positive and negative. This paper presents results from a series of semi-structured interviews with 12 students and 6 instructors about their awareness, experiences, and preferences regarding the use of tools powered by generative AI in computing classrooms. The results suggest that Generative AI (GAI) tools will play an increasingly significant role in computing education. However, students and instructors also raised numerous concerns about how these models should be integrated to best support the needs and learning goals of students. We also identified interesting tensions and alignments that emerged between how instructors and students prefer to engage with these models. We discuss these results and provide recommendations related to curriculum development, assessment methods, and pedagogical practice. As GAI tools become increasingly prevalent, it's important to understand educational stakeholders' preferences and values to ensure that these tools can be used for good and that potential harms can be mitigated.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343467","Generative models;large language models;computing education;student perceptions;instructor perceptions","Codes;Systematics;Computational modeling;Education;Natural languages;Curriculum development;Stakeholders","","8","","49","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a solution, concept-based explanations are gaining attention due to their human intuitiveness and their flexibility to describe both global and local model behaviors. Concepts are groups of similarly meaningful pixels that express a notion, embedded within the network's latent space and have commonly been hand-generated, but have recently been discovered by automated approaches. Unfortunately, the magnitude and diversity of discovered concepts makes it difficult to navigate and make sense of the concept space. Visual analytics can serve a valuable role in bridging these gaps by enabling structured navigation and exploration of the concept space to provide concept-based insights of model behavior to users. To this end, we design, develop, and validate ConceptExplainer, a visual analytics system that enables people to interactively probe and explore the concept space to explain model behavior at the instance/class/global level. The system was developed via iterative prototyping to address a number of design challenges that model users face in interpreting the behavior of deep learning models. Via a rigorous user study, we validate how ConceptExplainer supports these challenges. Likewise, we conduct a series of usage scenarios to demonstrate how the system supports the interactive analysis of model behavior across a variety of tasks and explanation granularities, such as identifying concepts that are important to classification, identifying bias in training data, and understanding how concepts can be shared across diverse and seemingly dissimilar classes.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2022.3209384","U.S. National Science Foundation(grant numbers:DUE-2216452); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9903285","Explainable AI;Concept Activation Vectors;Interactive Visual Analytics","Behavioral sciences;Deep learning;Analytical models;Visual analytics;Navigation;Computational modeling;Task analysis","","5","","55","IEEE","26 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing metrics usually focus on a single criterion each, such as how well the asset aligned with the input text. These metrics lack the flexibility to generalize to different evaluation criteria and might not align well with human preferences. Conducting user preference studies is an alternative that offers both adaptability and human-aligned results. User studies, however, can be very ex-pensive to scale. This paper presents an automatic, ver-satile, and human-aligned evaluation metric for text-to-3D generative models. To this end, we first develop a prompt generator using GPT-4V to generate evaluating prompts, which serve as input to compare text-to-3D models. We further design a method instructing GPT-4V to compare two 3D assets according to user-defined crite-ria. Finally, we use these pairwise comparison results to assign these models Elo ratings.

In this study, we propose a novel deep neural network model called Cycle Consistent Multi-Task Variational Autoencoder (CycleMVAE) to simultaneously investigate pairwise translation of emotional features, signal reconstruction, and emotion classification across two different EEG recording samples. CycleMVAE comprises two Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and a supervised classifier. Each VAE consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder of the first VAE transfers emotional properties from EEG sample X to a compact latent space Z, while the decoder retrieves these features from Z to transfer them to EEG sample Y. Similarly, the second VAE uses the compact latent space Z’ to transfer emotion features from EEG sample Y to EEG sample X. This forms a cyclic translation of feature among EEG sample recordings. The model is trained using reconstructed loss, cycle consistency loss, and latent vector regularization loss, with a supervised classifier used to categorize emotions into arousal, valence, and dominance categories. The proposed approach improves EEG classification performance while reducing pre-processing complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been validated by experimental findings on the multimodal DREAMER emotional database.","2642-6102","978-1-6654-8258-5","10.1109/TENSYMP55890.2023.10223616","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10223616","EEG;Multi-task Variational Autoencoders;Cycle-Consistent architecture;Affective Computing;Emotion Recognition","Emotion recognition;Databases;Computational modeling;Multitasking;Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Signal reconstruction","","1","","26","IEEE","28 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Analysis of social media posts and in-depth insights show that some people have suicide ideas. In order to save more lives, it is crucial to comprehend the behavior of suicidal attempters. However, identifying and explaining suicidal thoughts poses a significant challenge in psychiatry. Additionally, analysing suicidal behavior is a complex procedure involving several variables based on the individual’s preferences and the data type. Although traditional methods have been utilized to identify clinical factors for suicide ideation detection (SID), these models often lack interpretability and understanding. Therefore, the primary aim of this research is to apply several deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) techniques such as BERT, LSTM, BiLSTM, RF, SVM, GaussianNB, LR, and KNeighbors blending with interpretable models such as LIME and SHAP to provide valuable insights into the importance of different features and make models more transparent in the SID process. The experiments were conducted on a publicly available dataset comprising 24,101 posts, categorized as either suicidal or non-suicidal. The implemented method brings about significant enhancements in performance in comparison. A comparison of all performance measures reveals that the LSTM model is particularly good at processing and classifying textual data, with higher accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores than the other models tested.","","979-8-3503-9588-4","10.1109/BESC59560.2023.10386773","Australian Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386773","Suicide Ideation;Mental Health;Explainability;Classification;Deep Learning;Explainable AI","Support vector machines;Radio frequency;Deep learning;Social computing;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Data models","","1","","24","IEEE","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The objective of this paper is to reduce the burden from the weaver who other-wise have no insights on the market demand or customer preferences, which creates a demand supply gap and discourages them from continuing the profession of weaving as it costs them huge in terms of investment be it money needed for the looms or the time, and energy spent behind the loom in weaving the handwoven products.","","979-8-3503-6684-6","10.1109/IC3SE62002.2024.10593304","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10593304","Sustainable Business Model;Artificial Intelligence;Exploratory Data Analysis;Data Modelling & Tuning","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Manuals;Market research;Weaving;Data models;Artificial intelligence","","","","20","IEEE","23 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes a category-aware rule-based (CRule) approach for symbolic multihop reasoning. Specifically, given a KG, CRule first categorizes entities and constructs a category-aware KG; it then uses rules retrieved from the categorized KG to perform multihop reasoning on the original KG. Experiments on five datasets show that CRule is simple, is effective, and combines the advantages of symbolic and neural network methods. It overcomes symbolic reasoning’s complexity limitations, can perform reasoning on KGs of more than 300,000 edges, and can be three times more efficient than neural network models.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2023.3291567","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0103405); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62206282); Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDA27030100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10172317","","Cognition;Intelligent systems;Spread spectrum communication;Data mining;Computational modeling;Complexity theory;Knowledge graphs","","","","20","IEEE","4 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Recently, progress has been made in image reconstruction with non-invasive brain recordings, but it's still difficult to generate realistic images with high semantic fidelity due to the scarcity of data annotations. Unlike previous methods, this work casts the neural decoding into optimal transport (OT) and representation decoupling problems. Specifically, under discrete OT theory, we design a graph matching-guided neural representation learning framework to seek the underlying correspondences between conceptual semantics and neural signals, which yields a natural and meaningful self-supervisory task. Moreover, the proposed MindArt, structured with multiple stand-alone modal branches, enables the seamless incorporation of semantic representation into any visual style information, thus leaving it to have multi-modal reconstruction and training-free semantic editing capabilities. By doing so, the reconstructed images of MindArt have phenomenal realism both in terms of semantics and appearance. We compare our MindArt with leading alternatives, and achieve SOTA performance in different decoding tasks.

This research examines questions produced by ChatGPT, focusing on their alignment with different levels of Bloom's Taxonomy and their overall fluency and coherence. To assess the quality of the generated questions, we establish several scenarios for generation and subsequently evaluate the questions using both automated metrics and manual examination. Our empirical analysis shows that ChatGPT tends to produce high-quality questions; however, these questions predominantly fall within the categories of Remember, Understand, and Apply in Bloom's Taxonomy. It exhibits limited capacity for generating questions that require higher-order reasoning. Further enhancements are therefore necessary to enhance the question quality of this model, particularly with regard to the diversity of question types based on Bloom's Taxonomy.

Recent benchmarks do not address hallucinations in open-ended free-form responses, which we term “Type I hallucinations”. Instead, they focus on hallucinations responding to very specific question formats-typically a multiple-choice response regarding a particular object or attribute-which we term “Type II hallucinations”. Additionally, such benchmarks often require external API calls to models which are subject to change. In practice, we observe that a reduction in Type II hallucinations does not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations but rather that the two forms of halluci-nations are often anti-correlated. To address this, we propose THRONE, a novel object-based automatic framework for quantitatively evaluating Type I hallucinations in LVLM free-form outputs. We use public language models (LMs) to identify hallucinations in LVLM responses and compute informative metrics. By evaluating a large selection of recent LVLMs using public datasets, we show that an improvement in existing metrics do not lead to a reduction in Type I hallucinations, and that established benchmarks for measuring Type I hallucinations are incomplete. Finally, we provide a simple and effective data augmentation method to reduce Type I and Type II hallucinations as a strong baseline.","2575-7075","979-8-3503-5300-6","10.1109/CVPR52733.2024.02571","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10657848","hallucination;benchmark;LLM;LVLM;large language model;large vision-language model","Measurement;Training;Ethics;Computer vision;Accuracy;Computational modeling;Graphics processing units","","","","54","IEEE","16 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When such biases are incorporated into artificial intelligence models, the corresponding technological solutions and products can further entrench the social biases. Herein, a new method for investigating the extent to which latent biases in text-based training data affect a language model is presented. Potential gender bias is identified by deriving values assigned to male/female words via inverse operations from embedded expressions to the original words using the approximate inverse model explanation (AIME). In particular, AIME constructs approximate generalized inverse operators for black-box models. A biased embedded representation used in machine learning models as an internal representation of word/sentence vectors likely introduces bias into the overall prediction results of such models. The OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 large language model, which provides embedded expressions, is employed to determine the gender bias included in the proposed method. Experimental results show that the OpenAI textembedding-ada-002 model is partially gender-biased owing to the training text data. These results are expected to (i) contribute to the development of effective measures preventing gender bias during the design and training of language models, (ii) promote the identification and mitigation of gender bias in future language models, and (iii) provide insights into the effect of language models and their limitations from technical, social, and cultural perspectives.","2472-9671","979-8-3503-8535-9","10.1109/ICSC59802.2024.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10475634","gender bias;approximate inverse model explanation;language model;bias detection;embedding representation","Training;Machine learning algorithms;Inverse problems;Computational modeling;Semantics;Training data;Machine learning","","","","23","IEEE","22 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They are well-known for their low-cost, quick, and effective communication. However, the enhancement of social connectivity often creates negative impacts on society that contributes to online abuse, harassment, cyberbullying, cyber flashing, cybercrime, and online trolling. In this paper, we are focusing on cyber-flashing, the unsolicited sending of nude or sexual images, which is a common practice but often met with negative reactions from receivers. During and after COVID lockdown, cyber-flashing has been a serious threat on WhatsApp recently. The majority of study, meanwhile, has focused on identifying instances of cyberbullying rather than the effects of cyber-flashing. Cyber-flashing is the act of sending an inappropriate photo or video to another person, as well as exposing oneself to another via live video. An essential step in the detection of cyber-flashing is evaluating the level of risk in terms of abusiveness in the provided picture, or video. Therefore, the goal of this research is to create and refine a method that can effectively identify abusive cyber-flashing content and prevent inappropriate content sharing within the social media platforms or public Wi-Fi network. As a result, we have proposed a unique technique, where we employ a multi- stage model for identifying cyber-flashing photos and the proposed YOLOv3-YCbCr performs best in terms of metrics, with 98.14% accuracy, 95.58% specificity, and 97.27% sensitivity. First, the YOLOv3 technique is used to detect human presence in the image. Then, the YCbCr model is used for the skin detection and analysis. In the context of intelligent systems, skin detection is a difficult topic that has drawn a lot of attention from specialists and experts from the research community; the lack of uniform testing methodologies and standard benchmarks have made it difficult to compare different approaches fairly. Based on our studies, YOLOv3-YCbCr performs far better for skin segmentation than any prior hand-crafted approach method.","","979-8-3503-6509-2","10.1109/ICONSTEM60960.2024.10568789","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10568789","Cyber-flashing;You Only Look Once version 3(YOLOv3);WhatsApp;YCbCr Introduction","YOLO;Freeware;Sensitivity;Cyberbullying;Receivers;Skin;Internet telephony","","","","28","IEEE","28 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, HTC removes all the mentioned problems as storing, retrieving, and using the text as and when required is easier. Emotions are a basic and particularly important aspect of one’s life. To understand this important aspect of an individual’s life, we must detect emotions using affect data like text, voice, and image. We have used text as the effect data for this work. We can find a person’s emotions behind his text by sentiment analysis. Sentiment recognition and analysis is a topic with wide research as many brands, companies, and even famous personalities are very much interested in getting feedback and thus do the evaluation of their performance and knowing what people think about them around the world. Authors have proposed a model where they collected data from social media reviews and classified it into three broad categories, which are positive, negative, and neutral.

Processing-in-memory (PIM) accelerators for DNNs have been actively researched, specifically, with resistive random-access memory (RRAM), due to RRAM’s computing and memorizing capabilities and device merits. To the best of our knowledge, all previous PIM accelerators have saved weights into RRAMs and inputs (activations) into conventional memories—it naturally forms weight-stationary (WS) dataflow. WS has generally been considered the most optimized choice for high parallelism and data reuse. How-ever, WS-based PIM accelerators show fundamental limitations: first, remaining high dependency on DRAM and buffers for fetching and saving inputs (activations); second, a remarkable number of extra RRAMs for transposed weights and additional computational intermediates in training; third, coarse-grained arrays demanding high-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and introducing poor utilization in depthwise and pointwise convolution; last, degraded accuracy due to its sensitivity to weights which are affected by RRAM’s nonideality. On the other hand, we observe that IS dataflow, where RRAMs retain inputs (activations), can effectively address the limitations of WS, because of low dependency by only loading weights, no need for extra RRAMs, feasibility of fine-grained accelerator design, and less impact of input (activation) variance on accuracy. But IS dataflow is hardly achievable by the existing crossbar structure because it is difficult to implement kernel sliding and preserve the high parallelism. To support kernel movement, we constitute a cell structure with two-transistor-one-RRAM (2T1R). Based on the 2T1R cell, we design a novel three-dimensional (3D) architecture for high parallelism in batch training. Our experiment results prove the potential of INCA. Compared to the WS accelerator, INCA achieves up to 20.6× and 260× energy efficiency improvement in inference and training, respectively; 4.8× (inference) and 18.6× (training) speedup as well. While accuracy in WS drops to 15% in our high-noise simulation, INCA presents an even more robust result as 86% accuracy.","2378-203X","978-1-6654-7652-2","10.1109/HPCA56546.2023.10070992","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10070992","","Training;Deep learning;Three-dimensional displays;Sensitivity;Convolution;Microprocessors;Computer architecture","","2","","72","IEEE","24 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there exist listwise methods, they have low efficiency and are not particularly adequate for general implicit feedback situations. To that end, in this paper, we propose a new framework, namely Collaborative List-and-Pairwise Filtering (CLAPF), which aims to introduce pairwise thinking into listwise methods. Specifically, we first smooth a well-known rank-biased measure called Mean Average Precision (MAP) as a low-bound version to make it can be optimized. After that, we combined the objective functions of optimizing the MAP with pairwise comparisons. The CLAPF framework is a new hybrid model that provides the idea of utilizing a listwise measure in a pairwise way on implicit feedback.","2375-026X","979-8-3503-2227-9","10.1109/ICDE55515.2023.00327","National Key Research and Development Program of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184775","Recommender Systems;Collaborative Filtering","Filtering;Computational modeling;Collaborative filtering;Collaboration;Linear programming;Data engineering;Computational complexity","","1","","5","IEEE","26 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we introduce a method of encoding graph topology information as vertex data by assigning each edge and vertex an opacity value, which is the confidence with which the model thinks that that edge or vertex should be present in the output graph. Graph neural cellular automata equipped with this encoding method, henceforth referred to as translucent graph neural cellular automata, were tested in their ability to learn to reconstruct graphs from random subgraphs of them as a proof of concept.

Usually, the scheduling algorithm considers only a limited sample of the infrastructure nodes, typically obtained through random sampling. The sampling reduces the number of nodes, which need to be evaluated in the scheduling pipeline, making the scheduling process more saleable. Unfortunately, current sampling approaches become largely inefficient when the infrastructure is heterogeneous and specific, scarce node characteristics are required to successfully execute a workload. Computing continuum infrastructures are heterogeneous, hence, we need to re-think the sampling process to keep it viable at scale while also being able to identify and leverage the heterogeneity of the Edge-Cloud continuum resources. In this article, we present Intelligent Sampling - a novel technique for improving sampling in large-scale and heterogeneous infrastructures. We develop a model for any heterogeneous infrastructure. Based on this model, we provide a method to sample the infrastructure nodes more accurately, considering the specific task at hand.

Secondly, we design and implement quantization-aware primitives and inter-primitive optimizations to speed up GNN training. Finally, we integrate Tango with the popular Deep Graph Library (DGL) system and demonstrate its superior performance over the state-of-the-art approaches on various GNN models and datasets.","2167-4337","979-8-4007-0109-2","10.1145/3581784.3607037","NSF(grant numbers:2212370,2319880,2328948,2319975,2331301); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10485136","","Training;Quantization (signal);High performance computing;Computational modeling;Graph neural networks;Libraries;Optimization","","","","88","","4 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we examined the emotional changes of 69 students during the lectures of the C Language Programming Foundation and Computational Thinking in central China. This paper presents a method using Yolov7 and the convolutional neural network CoAtNet to monitor students' emotional evolution by analyzing their facial expressions and recognizing academic affective states, including boring, confused, focus, happy, and neutral. The trained model has achieved a test accuracy of 76.0%. The results showed that focus increased at the beginning of the first 10 minutes of class and then began to decline. With the decline of focus emotion, students' neutral emotions increased. We found that when a new teaching session is performed, or the teaching method of naming questions is used, the students' emotion of focus increases briefly, lasting about 8–10 minutes. Subsequently, even if the varied teaching method was used to stimulate students' attention, their level of engagement did not increase significantly. It can be suggested that teachers can use teaching methods appropriately to promote students' attention. However, students' attention span is limited, and teachers should pay attention to methods and time to improve teaching quality effectively.","","979-8-3503-2572-0","10.1109/CSTE59648.2023.00015","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62277029); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:CCNU22JC011); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261563","facial expression recognition;emotional evolution;improving classroom teaching","Emotion recognition;Face recognition;Computational modeling;Education;C languages;Convolutional neural networks;Programming profession","","1","","26","IEEE","29 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, a critical challenge emerges - the risk of ""hallucinations,"" where LLMs generate factually incorrect or misleading information. This paper proposes Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting (CCVP), a novel technique specifically designed to mitigate hallucinations in educational LLMs. CCVP leverages the strengths of multiple LLMs, a Principal Language Model (PLM) and Auxiliary Language Models (ALMs), to verify the accuracy and educational relevance of the PLM's response to a prompt. Through a series of prompts and assessments, CCVP harnesses the diverse perspectives of various LLMs and incorporates human expertise for intricate cases. This method addresses the limitations of relying on a single model and fosters critical thinking skills in learners within the educational context. We detail the CCVP approach with examples specifically applicable to educational settings, such as geography. We also discuss its strengths and limitations, including computational cost, data reliance, and ethical considerations. We highlight its potential applications in educational disciplines, including fact-checking content, detecting bias, and promoting responsible LLM use. CCVP presents a promising avenue for ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of LLM-generated educational content. Further research and development will refine its scalability, address potential biases, and solidify its position as a vital tool for harnessing the power of LLMs while fostering responsible knowledge dissemination in education.","2161-377X","979-8-3503-6205-3","10.1109/ICALT61570.2024.00066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10645894","Educational Language Models -LLMs;Hallucination Mitigation;Comparative and Cross-Verification Prompting -CCVP;Multi-model Approach;Responsible LLM Use","Geography;Solid modeling;Accuracy;Scalability;Prevention and mitigation;Computational modeling;Education","","","","10","IEEE","29 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been a truism that actors who are more receptive to change can be more successful and efficient than their peers in business markets. Perhaps the most significant changes in recent years have confirmed this even more. One only has to think of the impact of pandemic COVID-19, the energy crisis or the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. In a very short period of time, these events have brought about very significant changes and their impact has been largely negative for most economic actors. If it has not been sufficiently understood so far why it can be important to adapt to changes in a timely and appropriate way, or why good crisis management practices can be important, perhaps everyone will now. Meanwhile, other trends are shaping the global economy and will have an impact on the future state of the economy and society.

Stress often impacts the sleep cycle of an individual resulting in a severe impact on their physical and mental health. Stress even affects the cognitive functioning of an individual, which refers to the mental processes involving memory management, decision thinking, etc. So, eventually, stress becomes a common factor for both. This study proposes an approach helping individuals to reduce stress by turning towards a proper sleep cycle eventually resulting in an increase in cognitive functioning. This paper uses the conventional method of machine learning through which it could be justified that as stress increases the number of hours slept by the person decreases. Furthermore, a correlation was established between sleep stress and cognitive functioning through which it could be concluded that sleep affects cognitive functioning. Previous research studies suggest that there is a link between video games and increased cognitive functioning, So, this study proposed the solution as a game named CANDY CRUSH which is much popular among middle age groups as it is easy to learn and can prove to be stress releaser for them eventually leading to better cognitive functioning.","","979-8-3503-0336-0","10.1109/CISCT57197.2023.10351244","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10351244","Cognitive Functioning;Sleep Disturbance;Conventional Method;Stress","Video games;Correlation;Mood;Memory management;Human factors;Mental health;Machine learning","","","","21","IEEE","21 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The use of computer vision techniques to categorize face emotion has been extensively studied. Given the difficulties and restrictions of databases, such as the use of static data or facial capture in artificial contexts, these have had different degrees of success. As a result, we think that novel preprocessing methods are necessary to increase the precision of facial expression detection models. In this study, we suggest a novel, yet straightforward, approach to improving the precision of face emotion identification. Our research was done using the FER2013 dataset, which includes static facial photos of 7 basic emotions. Resizing and Normalization image preprocessing techniques were applied on the dataset prior to the splitting into train and test sets. The training images were split into train and test sets in the ratios of 75% and 25% respectively.

Due to the machine learning and deep learning concepts humans teach the machine to detect the threats. By taking the help of big data machine learn the different patterns of attacks. By the concepts of deep learning the machine is able to learn from experiences, it can remember the patterns of different attacks. Neural networks make it possible for a machine to think like humans.

At first, it picks cluster centres at random and measures how far apart k points are. This kind of cluster centre is called k centroids, and it will keep changing until there are no more changes. When making applications that use machine intelligence, a machine should be able to think like a person and make the right choices. In this case, it's not possible to get k-points from the user.

This article proposes a multi-granularity graph convolutional neural network (MG-GCN) based on object relations to enhance the versatility of GCN and demonstrate its reasoning ability. The MG-GCN efficiently solves complex multi-label classification problems in information systems. Firstly, based on the multi-granularity thinking, the attribute set is divided into several attribute subsets based on granularity. Secondly, a graph of differences representing the relationship between objects is established under each attribute subset. Finally, based on the attention mechanism and multiple difference matrices of objects, MG-GCN is proposed and applied to multi-label classification within information systems.

The same in mathematics: to handle one million mathematical points we typically inscribe them in an equation, so we deal with just a few lines of algebraic script instead of having to deal with one million coordinates. In applied sciences, as in design, we do not handle dimensionless mathematical points, but physical particles, pixels, or voxels—chunks of images and of three-dimensional objects; yet the logic is the same. No human can notate and calculate one billion parts (chunks, pixels, voxels) one by one. Life is too short for that. When dealing with data, simplification is the humans' inescapable lot.

This approach can provide students quantitative, comparative insights into the differences between optimal and student implemented solution, and allowing educators to offer targeted feedback, thereby optimizing the learning and abstraction processes in algorithm design through deliberate practice. Background: Abstraction is considered one of the most impor11 tant skills in problem solving. Many studies in programming have shown that higher abstraction capability can significantly simplify problems, reduce program complexity and improve efficiency. However, it is difficult to develop criteria to measure the level of abstraction, and there is still a lack of relevant systematic research. Research Questions: 1) How can students’ abstraction ability in programming be effectively measured? 2) How to develop programming education and training methods based on the measurement of abstraction ability? Methodology: Forty-six grade 10 students participated in the experiment, divided into two groups for programming train23 ing using information-entropy-based assessment and traditional learning methods. Their level of computational thinking, algo25 rithmic efficiency improvements, and test scores were used to measure performance and to analyze the effectiveness of the training methods. Findings: Through empirical research, this article finds that information-entropy-based assessment can reflect the differences in problem solving among students possessing varying capa31 bilities.

This entropy reveals that the more underdeveloped documents are, the more demanding their content-related modification becomes. It was also found that the time and data required to complete a modification task in an erroneous document is several times more than in its correct counterpart. This finding leads to the end-user paradox: the less trained end-users are, the more errors they make, and the modification of their documents requires more resources. To resolve these discrepancies, the present study defines the sustainability rate of natural language digital texts which calculates the losses – the waste of human resources, time, workspace, computers, energy, frustration, working in bees, losing data – generated by negligent text management. Furthermore, we present examples of how manual and enumerated lists behave to modifications in a 213-page long document and conclude from our investigations that while the waste of human and machine resources occurs repeatedly in erroneous documents, the sustainability rate remains low. To prove the necessity of correction, we cleared the sample document, which took approximately 67 hours of two experts of our research group ( $2\times67$  hours). With this method, we found that the correction of errors can be extremely demanding, but uses resources only once, and further modifications in the now correct document need only the content-required amount of time, activities, entropy, and resources, in accordance with the expectations of the person intended to update the document. To correct documents, we present the Error Recognition Model, which is proved effective and efficient in digital education. All our findings indicate that both education and industry should adapt the presented approach (1) to develop students’ and end-users’ computational thinking skills, (2) to manage and take advantage of errors, (3) to recognize connections between the structure of the text and the complex word processing tools, (4) to pay attention to digital sustainability – beyond hardware and software development and recycling – with a focus on the human factor. Recently, the Error Recognition Model is a reactive problem-solving approach, whose effectiveness is justified.

This is because it harms the brain cells related to memory and thinking abilities, and it's hard to tell apart from normal brain patterns in scans. Detecting it needs a special way to represent features for sorting it out. Deep learning methods can acquire such representations from the MRI data. In this paper, five different transfer learning models are trained in 15 binary classifiers, each of them can classify two of Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and Cognitively Normal (CN) classes. This method finds the best transfer learning model for classifying each binary comparison.

These achievements, however, are solely reliant on properly labelled training data. When presented with a few samples of noisy-labelled images, the network training strategy might encounter difficulties, resulting in a suboptimal classification models. The quality of medical picture annotations strongly depends on the knowledge and experience of the annotators, which makes this difficulty more acute in the context of medical image analysis. Such problem arises due to a number of reasons ranging from human error, inexperience or even misreading of the images. But at the same time, proper labels are exceptionally useful in training models, while improperly labelled data actually hampers the efficiency of the model. Label for a lot of the image dataset out there is actually already generated, but when we think about the noisy labelled data and go for an unsupervised learning model instead of a supervised model the labels that are correct are also going to waste. To solve this problem without wasting labels, a sparsely supervised learning strategy based on transfer learning is constructed with the aid of the keras Xception model. This paper compares the efficiency of a sparsely supervised learning model employing transfer learning to that of other traditional CNN models based on their performance metrics.","","979-8-3503-9926-4","10.1109/ICACITE57410.2023.10183290","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10183290","Sparsely supervised learning;weakly supervised learning;transfer learning;skin cancer;image classification","Training;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Supervised learning;Transfer learning;Data models;Noise measurement","","1","","21","IEEE","24 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Decision- making encompasses not only intelligence and perception but also emotions. Emotion Detection is helpful in Bio Feedback Therapy for ASD. Positive emotions, for example mostly tend to facilitate forward-thinking and successful decision-making while negative emotions often contribute to poor well-being or depression. A transformer model, a type of neural network architecture, possesses the capability to automatically convert one form of input into another form of output. This work intends to investigate various signals that may be useful in identifying emotions for the purpose of predicting autism as well as transformer model-based algorithms that may be useful in determining the Autism Severity Grading.

The model's performance is evaluated on actual datasets with recognition of each temporal and spatial dimension. Results display the effectiveness of the proposed technique in predicting destiny values of time collection with accuracy higher than individual predictions. Further, the model also can cope with minor adjustments within the shape of facts, allowing for excessive flexibility within the analysis and forecasting procedure.

To remove these challenges, the simulation is made painstakingly precise and dependable. Case studies may show how quantum systems can simulate complicated situations like astronomical object motions and subatomic particle activity under harsh conditions.

In this study, we discovered this new approach to classify a person's current mental state through convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on the analysis of eye, mouth and hand positions. We use extensive data to train and evaluate our model, which includes video recordings and images that record various human activities and emotions. Pre-processing techniques including normalization and scaling are used to improve model reliability. We use a CNN architecture that is optimized for feature extraction from facial and hand movements and uses both spatial and temporal information from the input data. By extracting the main features of the eyes, mouth and hand positions and movements, we try to capture subtle clues that indicate different emotional states such as happiness, sadness etc., as well as cognitive processes such as thinking, imagining and creating. Experimental results show promising classification accuracy for detecting different mental states, with better performance than basic methods. Our approach provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between body language and mental states, contributing to the understanding of human behaviour.

Delays in medical treatment due to not predicting the disease can lead to other serious complications in the future. Therefore, doctors must think and work harder to assess patients early with factors influencing chronic disease risk. Many studies have carried out disease prediction focused only on one to two disease predictions. Still, research related to risk prediction for four diseases simultaneously has not been carried out in health and medical services. This study makes a risk prediction model for patients suffering from one or four chronic diseases, which goes through several stages in data mining from medical record data and assessments. We used 29 variables from two combination data sources, calculated using the C4.5 algorithm to predict the patient's risk for the disease. Based on the accuracy test results, the chronic disease prediction model has an accuracy value of 84%.This shows that the resulting model has good decision-making and high accuracy.

Using the Chi-square test, we quantitatively evaluate different clusters driven by various unsupervised learning methods on the multimodal SKEP dataset. Furthermore, for a more practical real-life application, we achieved automatic persona prediction based on the attention regulation behaviors of learners. The subject-independent evaluation results indicate the best classification accuracy of 70% for the four-level classification task, differentiating three personas of learners with needs and another without feedback needs.

Accordingly, AI agents will be grounded in the physical environment, going through subjective experiences and acquiring the needed knowledge that will lead to understanding and cognition. In our article, we explore the path toward realizing the true vision of AGI through AI embodiment, where we dig into the different types of thinking required to achieve knowledge, and hence, cognition and understanding. Furthermore, we look through the evolution of generative AI models, and shed light on the limitations of auto-regression in large language models (LLMs), with the aim to answer the question: is sensory grounding (through 6G) necessary, and enough, to achieve understanding in LLMs? Finally, we identify the main pillars of AGI and unveil how 6G networks will orchestrate the development of AGI systems.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.015.2300521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10579547","","Artificial intelligence;Cognition;6G mobile communication;Grounding;Computational modeling;Decision making;Brain modeling","","1","","","IEEE","1 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

The lab uses virtual machines to provide students with the necessary computational power to carry out the course activities, along with the correct version of the software. The flipped remote lab approach combines the elements of flipped classroom and peer assessment, making it suitable for face-to-face, totally online, or hybrid classes. Prior to each of the two lectures, students begin to practice by replicating the instructor's demonstrations in a set of concise tutorials. Upon completion of the assigned tasks, students carry out self-assessments of their own modeling, in addition to assessing two models created by their peers. A rubric comprising three questions facilitates the assessment process and allows providing feedback on each response. During the subsequent lecture, students work together with the instructor to address challenges encountered in their modeling, exploring also the advanced aspects of software usage that time constraints preclude in a traditional setting. The analysis of the flipped remote lab results reveals that student responses in peer-assessment activities are relevant to the posed questions. Moreover, the students who realized the models demonstrated a comparable level of rigor in self-assessment as their mates who reviewed their works. While students express a high degree of appreciation for the laboratory activities, a notable concern is the highlighted heavy workload. Increasing the allocated time for task completion can help mitigate the workload impact.

The following paper will handle the ways that character development is changing in modern fiction. It investigates the ways in which AI technologies are outlining the way the creation, representation, and perception of characters in fiction are being developed. That means AI is advancing in character creation in ways that open up a whole new set of doors for writers: the use of powerful tools to generate, field, analyze, and refine their characters in ways previously unthinkable. Using the algorithms of natural language processing (NLP), these days, AI is used to help write dialogue, create characters with their traits, and sometimes even develop the entire character’s arc. This union of human creativity and computational powers doesn’t just make the process of writing faster but, rather, opens doors for new possibilities in innovative storytelling. AI-driven analytics help authors to pick up the insight into reader preferences and trends that tend to help them develop character traits and the storyline, most appealing to the readers. The application of machine-learning algorithms to vast repositories of literature seems to derive character dynamics and tropes that are so archetyped, but their renderings are much more nuanced and impactful. At the same time, this AI character raises very basic questions about authorship, creativity, and the nature of the story. As more and more writers adopt AI for character generation, they do raise some question about authenticity and originality.","","979-8-3503-6016-5","10.1109/ICACITE60783.2024.10617440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10617440","Artificial Intelligence;Characterization;Modern Fiction;Technology;Creativity;Narrative;AI-Generated Characters;Ethical Considerations;Storytelling;Literature","Ethics;Sensitivity;Heuristic algorithms;Machine learning;Writing;Rendering (computer graphics);Market research","","","","30","IEEE","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, achieving robust and accurate extraction of power lines in aerial images is essential to enable intelligent UAVs inspection. Unfortunately, power line extraction is an extremely challenging task, and all the current methods attempt to utilize a single model to solve the problem of power line extraction in complex and variable scenes. This results in insufficient generalization ability and suboptimal computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a power line scene classification network based on complexity assessment, named SceneNet, which can provide a solution for tackling power line extraction challenges. First, we propose a human–machine hybrid reasoning model to obtain the ground truth of image complexity reasonably and build the first benchmark dataset that can be used for automatic classification research of power line scenes. Second, we propose an improved StyleGAN3 model and loop transfer learning strategy for data augmentation. Most importantly, the SceneNet comprises a multifeature joint embedding module and a feature encoding–decoding module. On one hand, it achieves the multilevel fusion of artificial features and high-dimensional semantic features. On the other hand, we use a self-attention mechanism to enable full use of the contextual association between each block of the fusion feature map. The SceneNet has successfully achieved the mapping and pattern recognition between the abstract concept and the concrete features. Experimental results demonstrate that the SceneNet is obviously superior to the existing 12 state-of-the-art models, and it provides guidance and delineation of applicable scenes for power line extraction methods.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2023.3313993","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52307092,52177109); Natural Science Project of Zhengzhou Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:22ZZRDZX43); Hubei Province Key R&D Program Funded Projects(grant numbers:2020BAB109); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10246990","Human–machine hybrid reasoning;image complexity (IC) assessment;multifeature joint embedding;scene classification;UAVs inspection","Feature extraction;Complexity theory;Data mining;Inspection;Data models;Adaptation models;Standards","","","","61","IEEE","11 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional approaches in this area predict the future behavior of dynamical systems by inferring the evolution function. However, these methods may confront obstacles due to the presence of missing variables, which are usually attributed to challenges in measurement and a partial understanding of the system of interest. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the autoregressive with slack time series (ARS) model, that simultaneously estimates the evolution function and imputes missing variables as a slack time series. Assuming time-invariance and linearity in the (underlying) entire dynamical time series, our experiments demonstrate the ARS model’s capability to forecast future time series. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a 2-dimensional time-invariant and linear system can be reconstructed by utilizing observations from a single, partially observed dimension of the system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3365724","Strategic Research Projects from the Research Organization of Information and Systems through the Project “The Statistical and Mathematical Modeling for Plasma Physics and Complementary Plasma Data,”(grant numbers:2022-SRP-13); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:21K17718,22H05106); Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) Precursory Research for Embryonic Science and Technology (PRESTO)(grant numbers:JPMJPR212A); JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:22K13979,23H03460); New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO)(grant numbers:JPNP22100843-0); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10433494","Autoregressive model;completely missing variables;dynamical system;slack time series","Time series analysis;Mathematical models;Dynamical systems;Predictive models;Forecasting;Delays;Dynamics;Autoregressive processes","","","","31","CCBYNCND","13 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Repeated Builds During Code Review: An Empirical Study of the OpenStack Community","R. Maipradit; D. Wang; P. Thongtanunam; R. G. Kula; Y. Kamei; S. McIntosh","University of Waterloo, Canada; Kyushu University, Japan; The University of Melbourne, Australia; Nara Institute of Science and Technology, Japan; Kyushu University, Japan; University of Waterloo, Canada",2023 38th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE),"8 Nov 2023","2023","","","153","165","Code review is a popular practice where developers critique each others' changes. Since automated builds can identify low-level issues (e.g., syntactic errors, regression bugs), it is not uncommon for software organizations to incorporate automated builds in the code review process. In such code review deployment scenarios, submitted change sets must be approved for integration by both peer code reviewers and automated build bots. Since automated builds may produce an unreliable signal of the status of a change set (e.g., due to “flaky” or non-deterministic execution behaviour), code review tools, such as Gerrit, allow developers to request a “recheck”, which repeats the build process without updating the change set. We conjecture that an unconstrained recheck command will waste time and resources if it is not applied judiciously. To explore how the recheck command is applied in a practical setting, in this paper, we conduct an empirical study of 66,932 code reviews from the OpenStack community. We quantitatively analyze (i) how often build failures are rechecked; (ii) the extent to which invoking recheck changes build failure outcomes; and (iii) how much waste is generated by invoking recheck. We observe that (i) 55% of code reviews invoke the recheck command after a failing build is reported; (ii) invoking the recheck command only changes the outcome of a failing build in 42% of the cases; and (iii) invoking the recheck command increases review waiting time by an average of 2,200% and equates to 187.4 compute years of waste-enough compute resources to compete with the oldest land living animal on earth. Our observations indicate that the recheck command is frequently used after the builds fail, but does not achieve a high likelihood of build success. Based on a developer survey and our history-based quantitative findings, we encourage reviewer teams to think twice before rechecking and be considerate of waste. While recheck currently generates plenty of wasted computational resources and bloats waiting times, it also presents exciting future opportunities for researchers and tool builders to propose solutions that can reduce waste.","2643-1572","979-8-3503-2996-4","10.1109/ASE56229.2023.00030","Australian Research Council(grant numbers:DE210101091); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10298533","Code Review;Continuous Integration;Waste","Surveys;Codes;Automation;Animals;Computer bugs;Organizations;Syntactics","","2","","47","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Even though the most important advantage of the distributed network is raising the level of security, the problem of security vulnerabilities with the extended networks remains. This paper is devoted to a novel strategy of Federated Learning (FL) that could become an applied solution for enhancing the safety of the IoT. Therefore, based on its decentralized knowledge process, FL allows IoT devices to cooperate in achieving common purposes without endangering data pri vacy. The paper uses this thinking method to deal with scalability, model personalization, and non-IID data that aren’t IID distributing, suggesting solutions through model aggregation techniques or Artificial Intelligence (AI). Experimental evidence highlights that FL is very useful in enhancing IoT security irrespective of the diversity of its applications. To this end, residents of smart homes experienced a 17% increase in detecting the anomalies through the setting up of FL. This situation was replicated in the industrial Internet of Things, where the false positive rates were reduced from 20% to 5%, thus improving the system’s efficiency. Furthermore, in the FL context in healthcare IoT ecosystems, this blazes a trail for privacy-preserving data analytics, preserving patient confidentiality and systematic profiling of noteworthy health trends. These findings thus demonstrate that FL is a feasible way of dealing with the security challenges of IoT scalable, promptly and in a manner that maintains user privacy. The article takes part in a conversation about ways to strengthen the security of IoT networks. Such a framework is based on the computational power of IoT devices. It allows us to detect and prevent threats in time. Nonetheless, it urges extensive R&D attempts to be introduced to develop better security solutions in IoT. Without the involvement of different technologies, it won’t be easy to ensure safety and create some reliable IoT ecosystems.","","979-8-3503-7519-0","10.1109/ICAAIC60222.2024.10575903","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10575903","Internet of Things (IoT);Federated Learning (FL);Cybersecurity;Data Privacy;Decentralized Machine Learning","Privacy;Federated learning;Scalability;Ecosystems;Safety;Internet of Things;Security","","","","21","IEEE","2 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This approach has practical applications in various domains and has garnered significant attention in both industry and academia. An interesting application of this technique is segmented style transfer where a segmentation algorithm is used to locate objects within an image and then the style transfer method is performed locally, producing images with different styles for different objects. This approach opens up possibilities for creating visually striking compositions by seamlessly blending various artistic styles onto specific objects within an image, allowing for a new level of creative expression. This paper proposes a novel method that combines Segment Anything Model (SAM), a state-of-the-art vision transformer-based image segmentation model developed by Facebook, with style transfer. Our approach includes performing localized style transfer in selected segmentation regions of an image using classical style transfer algorithms. To ensure smooth transitions between the stylized and non-stylized border we also develop our loss function with a border smoothing technique. Experimental results demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology, including the ability to infuse multiple artistic styles into different objects within an image. The contributions of this work include integrating SAM with style transfer, proposing a novel loss function, evaluating the segmented style transfer in multiple content regions, comparing with state-of-the-art approaches, and experimenting with multiple style images for diverse stylization.

In an  $m$ -polar fuzzy graph ( $m$ PFG), each node and edge is associated with  $m$ -components, connected through minimal relationships. However, if one desires to incorporate maximum, average, or other intermediate relationships between nodes and edges, the  $m$ PFG concept becomes inadequate as in the  $m$ -polar fuzzy model, only minimum relation is considered. To address this limitation, a generalized model of  $m$ PFG is introduced in this article, allowing for a broader range of relationships to be considered simultaneously. This paper also discusses the properties of generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy environments and generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy graphs ( $\text{G}m$ PFGs), highlighting their isomorphism. Several significant findings and insights are presented in this paper. The article delves into the properties and characteristics of generalized  $m$ -polar fuzzy planar graphs ( $\text{G}m$ PFPGs) and explores various intriguing aspects related to them.

Parameters related to exploration paths were used to analyze the exploration patterns that users follow during their exploration.

However, the sensitivity surrounding suicide-related data poses challenges in accessing large-scale, annotated datasets necessary for training effective machine learning models. To address this limitation, we introduce an innovative strategy that leverages the capabilities of generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, Flan-T5, and Llama, to create synthetic data for suicidal ideation detection. Our data generation approach is grounded in social factors extracted from psychology literature and aims to ensure coverage of essential information related to suicidal ideation. In our study, we benchmarked against state-of-the-art NLP classification models, specifically, those centered around the BERT family structures. When trained on the real-world dataset, UMD, these conventional models tend to yield F1-scores ranging from 0.75 to 0.87. Our synthetic data-driven method, informed by social factors, offers consistent F1-scores of 0.82 for both models, suggesting that the richness of topics in synthetic data can bridge the performance gap across different model complexities. Most impressively, when we combined a mere 30% of the UMD dataset with our synthetic data, we witnessed a substantial increase in performance, achieving an F1-score of 0.88 on the UMD test set.

This framework aims to streamline the predictive process by pinpointing key variables that significantly influence quality assessments. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of a methodology that precisely determines the criticality of chemical inputs, both their exact values and their correct order, to identify which inputs significantly contribute to the quality assessment of a sensory perception, such as taste. The centerpiece of our paper is a vibrant 3D pie chart that illustrates the percentage criticality of different input variables for perceiving the quality of red wine. This chart symbolizes the essence of our paper: a ‘pie’ representing the empirical conclusion, not mere conjecture. Through this paper, we have shown that it is possible to quantify a qualitative, perceptual aspect like taste perception, which is often believed to be assessable only through subjective conjecture.

The study first proposes a digital teaching system that enables the IoT and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to play a role in art education by monitoring students’ creative state in real-time, providing immediate feedback, and facilitating the generation of creative works. The system framework includes sensor nodes, an IoT platform, a GAN model, and a user interface to build a real-time interactive environment. Sensor nodes constantly collect physiological, movement, and environmental data from students, and the GAN model receives student data from the IoT platform, combining creative input from students to generate artwork in real-time. The generated works are transmitted to the discriminator through the IoT platform, which evaluates their quality and provides real-time feedback. Students interact with the system through the user interface, observe the generated artwork, adjust generator parameters, and propose new ideas. These interactions influence further artistic creation. The WikiArt public art creation dataset is selected to establish the experimental foundation, and the experimental evaluation focuses on image generation quality, system performance, and student learning outcomes. It is compared with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The research results indicate that the designed IoT and GANs integrated system remarkably outperforms DCGAN and VAE in image generation quality, with an Inception Score of 4.5, which is more diverse and recognizable than other models.

Rule-based reasoning is a relatively easy-to-implement approach that can solve real-world problems. Rule-based systems rely on a set of assertions that constitute the working memory and a set of rules that govern what should be done with the set of assertions. Despite its relative simplicity, the working memory size is a critical factor in developing these systems, particularly for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we propose techniques for efficiently calculating the working memory size. Our results show that all three techniques, DWM, APS, and SAPS, performed well in different ways.

By combining the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with the optimization algorithm, this paper proposes an innovative method to realize the automatic generation of high-quality and diverse industrial design sketches. In the experiment, this paper selects SketchyCAD and other public data sets, trains them through deep learning model, and introduces genetic algorithm(GA) and differential evolution algorithm to optimize the parameters. In terms of experimental results, we observed that the quality of generated sketches was significantly improved, and the design sketches generated by the mode (GAN+GA) were more realistic and innovative. The introduction of optimization strategy further improves the generation effect and intelligently adjusts the model parameters to adapt to different design styles. In this paper, the influence of hyperparameter tuning is analyzed in detail, and it is found that the adjustment of learning rate plays a key role in generating quality and diversity. However, the experiment also revealed some challenges and room for improvement. We noticed that the generated results may have the risk of over-fitting in the training process, and with the increase of training times, the diversity gradually decreased. This suggests that more complex model structure and richer data sets are needed to improve the generalization performance. Generally speaking, this study provides new ideas and methods for the integration of deep learning and industrial design. By innovatively combining generation model and optimization algorithm, this research has contributed beneficial research results to the development of industrial design automation.

This model first utilizes the BERT model to encode and represent music data, capturing semantic and emotional information within the music data. Subsequently, the encoded music features are inputted into the Transformer network to learn the temporal relationships and structural patterns among music sequences, thereby generating new multi-track music compositions. The performance of this model is evaluated, revealing that compared to other algorithms, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of 95.98% in music generation prediction, with an improvement in precision by 4.77%.

To further validate the effectiveness of object-level explanations, we propose another approach (validation approach), which trains E2EDMs with object information as input and generates the importance of objects using general explanation methods. Both approaches generate object-level explanations, in order to compare these object-level explanations with traditional pixel-level explanations, we propose experimental methods to measure the persuasibility of explanations of E2EDMs through a subjective and objective method. The subjective method evaluates persuasibility based on the extent to which participants think the importance of features indicated by the explanations is correct. The objective method evaluates the persuasibility based on the human annotation similarity between provided with only the important part of images and provided with the complete images.

In particular, due to the inherent complexity of computing Nash equilibria, as well as the innate tendency of agents to choose nonequilibrium strategies, we construct two models of bounded rationality based on recursive reasoning. In the first model, named level- $k$  thinking, each agent assumes that everyone else has a cognitive level immediately lower than theirs and—given such an assumption—chooses their policy to be a best response to them. In the second model, named cognitive hierarchy, each agent conjectures that the rest of the agents have a cognitive level that is lower than theirs, but follows a distribution instead of being deterministic. To explicitly compute the boundedly rational policies, a level-recursive algorithm and a level-paralleled algorithm are constructed, where the latter one can have an overall reduced computational complexity. To further reduce the complexity in the communication layer, modifications of the proposed nonequilibrium strategies are presented, which do not require the action of a boundedly rational agent to be updated at each step of the stochastic game.

AD worsens over time and greatly impacts patients’ life and affects their important mental functions, including thinking, the ability to carry on a conversation, and judgment and response to environment. Clinically, there is no single test to effectively diagnose Alzheimer disease. However, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can be used to help in AD diagnosis by observing critical changes in the size of different brain areas, typically parietal and temporal lobes areas. In this work, an integrative mulitresolutional ensemble deep learning-based framework is proposed to achieve better predictive performance for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. Unlike ResNet, DenseNet and their variants proposed pipeline utilizes PartialNet in a hierarchical design tailored to AD detection using brain MRIs. The advantage of the proposed analysis system is that PartialNet diversified the depth and deep supervision. Additionally, it also incorporates the properties of identity mappings which makes it powerful in better learning due to feature reuse. Besides, the proposed ensemble PartialNet is better in vanishing gradient, diminishing forward-flow with low number of parameters and better training time in comparison to its counter network. The proposed analysis pipeline has been tested and evaluated on benchmark ADNI dataset collected from 379 subjects patients. Quantitative validation of the obtained results documented our framework's capability, outperforming state-of-the-art learning approaches for both multi-and binary-class AD detection.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2022.3219032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9935325","Ensemble PartialNet;alzheimer disorder;dementia;early diagnosis","Alzheimer's disease;Diseases;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain;Convolutional neural networks;Task analysis;Neuroimaging","Alzheimer Disease;Humans;Deep Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Brain;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Algorithms;Aged;Neuroimaging","4","","46","IEEE","2 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While most researches focus on behavior analytics, few of them integrate the personality that is also a closely related factor. As a classic indicator for personality representation, Myers–Briggs type indicator (MBTI) categorizes an individual into mutually exclusive types from four dichotomous axes (extraversion versus introversion, sensing versus intuition, thinking versus feeling, judging versus perceiving). Traditional recognition method using MBTI simply measures the user’s preference frequency in each axis through questionnaires, treating the dominant value as the identified result. Such a paradigm, however, represents all the people with only 16 types and cannot distinguish heterogeneous users clearly. This article proposes a novel personality recognition method using fuzzy logic. Different from previous classifications, our new method categorizes the individual in a continuous space and represents one’s personality in a more fine-grained level. We have designed comparative psychological tests for 77 people. The validation experiments on such tests indicate that the fuzzy-logic-based method is not only consistent with the classic MBTI tests (in the sense of defuzzification) but also provides the uncertainty for each personality type. Therefore, it can be viewed as a generalization of the classic MBTI tests and promotes the representation of individual’s heterogeneity for fine-grained analytics of digital human.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3245127","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076237,U1811463,T2192933,U1909204,62173329,62076239); Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:2021130); Major Science and Technology (S&T) Project of China(grant numbers:2021ZD0113704); Guangdong Provincial Key Research and Development Programme(grant numbers:2021B0101420001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10057228","Digital human;digital personality;fuzzy logic reasoning;fuzzy personality recognition;Myers-Briggs type indicator (MBTI)","Psychology;Fuzzy logic;Automation;Technological innovation;Uncertainty;Soft sensors;Social networking (online)","","2","","67","IEEE","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Here, we quantify the power of Big Tech by analyzing their acquisitions, market capitalization, and number of monthly active users. Moreover, we utilize the synthetic control method to estimate the effect of public scandals on the stock price of two Big Tech companies, and find that they had no lasting effect. We also analyze the number of tweets mentioning these scandals, and find that they quickly fade from the spotlight. To explore public sentiment, we survey 5300 participants across 25 countries, and find that those from countries with lower digital literacy and more authoritarian regimes are more trusting of Big Tech. Furthermore, we find that one in three feels they lack control over the data collected about them, and one in four feels that Big Tech knows what they are thinking, knows more about them than their best friend, and may even be secretly listening to their conversations. Additionally, one in four feels addicted to Big Tech products, have no choice but to use them, and wishes there were more companies to choose from. These findings highlight the adverse effect of the oligopolistic nature of Big Tech on consumer choice and help inform policy-makers aiming to curb their dominance.","2329-924X","","10.1109/TCSS.2023.3339183","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10379489","Policy;technology;trust","Companies;Internet;Surveys;Privacy;Social networking (online);Regulation;Indexes","","1","","71","CCBY","2 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research questions answered throughout this paper are two: the first one wonders if the Lebanese society and government are aware of the e-waste hazards and whether there is any action taken, on the governmental level, to avert an environmental catastrophe. Whereas the second one is concerned with finding out, what Lebanese think about e-waste and whether they are willing to fight against it? Answers to the first question resulted from interviews. The authors have visited Company A and NGO B, the first is concerned with collecting waste in greater Beirut while the second aims at spreading awareness to e-waste's dangers on governmental and social levels alike. Question two was discussed throughout surveys filled by random individuals from Lebanese society. The answers to both research questions came in a way that proves both hypotheses assumed at the beginning of the research, namely that e-waste poses a great threat to the Lebanese environment and that laws must be implemented to regulate collection and disposal of electronic appliances; also, e-cycling initiatives must be encouraged to reduce the quantities of generated e-waste. Hypothesis two if environment friendliness and affinity to right e-waste disposal depend on the educational level of any given citizen has been proven to be true while analyzing the answers in the survey.","","979-8-3503-0995-9","10.1109/ACTEA58025.2023.10193910","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193910","e-waste;e-cycling;WEEE;waste management;pollution;electrical appliances;electronic devices;environmental awareness;refurbished products;recycled materials;Engineering process","Surveys;Government;Companies;Electronic waste;Question answering (information retrieval);Hazards;Behavioral sciences","","1","","14","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various health-related data may be continually monitored and collected in smart environments due to the abundance of sensors. However, this data's vast quantity and complexity complicates accurate illness diagnosis and early management. Inspired by the coordinated actions of flocks of birds and swarms of insects, Swarm Intelligence provides a novel paradigm for analyzing and understanding this mountain of data. Hence, this paper proposes a Swarm Intelligence-enabled Disease Diagnosis (SI-DD) in smart environments using IoT-based sensors. Smart systems use algorithms motivated by swarm behaviour to assess data from several sensors in concert, allowing for faster, more accurate illness diagnosis. As a shape of collective swarm intelligence, Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) enables make healthcare treatments more effective. As a result, sufferers get care tailor-made to their unique desires, thinking about their scientific history and the kingdom of the healthcare machine. This article examines the most distinguished makes use of the Internet of Things and Swarm Intelligence in healthcare. It highlights how those techniques have already shown their promise for higher contamination detection. With this in thoughts, it's clear that the usage of clever sensors prepared with Swarm Intelligence for infection detection in clever settings is a viable path toward enhancing healthcare results and the first-rate of existence for sufferers.

Yet, these strategies mainly concentrate on postincident identification of malevolent users, hinging on static training datasets that categorize individuals based on historical activities. Diverging from this approach, we advocate for a forward-thinking methodology, which utilizes user data to foresee and mitigate potential threats before their realization, thereby cultivating more secure, equitable, and unbiased online communities. To this end, our proposed technique forecasts malevolent activities by tracing the projected trajectories of user embeddings before any malevolent action materializes. For validation, we employed a dynamic directed multigraph paradigm to chronicle the evolving engagements between Twitter users. When juxtaposed against the identical dataset, our technique eclipses contemporary methodologies by an impressive 40.66% in F score (F1 score) in the anticipatory identification of harmful users.

With a brief description of the book, we prepare the formulation of the new tasks of the comparison. In doing so, the revolutionary change that took place in the infosphere of humanity with the co-evolution of computing, networking and representing information, and which is still in intensive development, must be taken into account. The book contrasts the stored program architecture based on Neumann’s principle with the neural network architecture of the brain. The numerical comparison is based on differences in the performance, number, and density of the active elements. The comparison cannot be continued in this way, because we are not dealing with individual computers, but with a system of cooperating machines organized in the Internet. The worlds of the two kinds of machines jointly use the latest collection of artificially created information carriers, the Data Sphere, and together they form the active information processing component of the Humanity’s infosphere. The carriers of information provide the common, materially existing object of computation and thinking, which I call formation in the paper. The information event, introduced in the paper, associate formation with information. Formation means information when the observation or creation of the formation in an information event is connected to the meaning for its owner. While the information processing of computers is only the transformation of formations, the assignment of meaning is carried on in an information event both before and after the transformation. In the most important information event, the owner is the human mind. The separating barrier between the two worlds is the information event. Within the computer systems, there are no more information events, only formations are transformed, in which the activation of program formations enables the automatic execution of the computation.","2471-9269","979-8-3503-4294-9","10.1109/CINTI59972.2023.10382029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10382029","computers;brain;mind;computing;information;infosphere;data sphere","Humanities;Semantics;Computer architecture;Biosphere;Mathematics;Internet;Task analysis","","","","13","IEEE","8 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The world around us is being significantly and swiftly changed by AI in all of its manifestations. Public law includes important facets such as nondiscrimination law and labor law. In a manner similar to this when artificial intelligence (AI) is applied to tangible technology like robots. In certain cases, artificial intelligence (AI) might be hardly noticeable to customers but evident to those who built and are using it. The behavior research offers suggestions for how to build enduring and beneficial interactions between intelligent robots and people. The human improvement is main obstacles in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence. Best practices in this area are not governed by any one strategy that is generally acknowledged. Machine learning is about to revolutionize society as it is know it. It is crucial to give intelligent computers a moral compass now more than ever before because of how divided mankind is.

The need for maintaining continuous connectivity of these devices has in turn led to re-thinking of the traditional design of wireless networks. In particular, the integration of 6G and Digital Twin (DT) is expected to reshape the network management as it offers powerful features in design, development and optimization processes. DT is a digital representation of physical entities, which are designed around a two-way information flow. Therefore, this technology not only collects data, and employs intelligent learning methods by performing complex computations, but it also can send feedback to improve system performance for 6G-enabled massive IoT. However, deploying such a technology requires addressing complex challenges such as limited resources, seamless connectivity and lack of trust between end users and network edge. To address these challenges, we formulate the resource allocation problem including edge computation and service migration in 6G-enabled massive IoT. The contributions are threefold: First, our DT-empowered architecture is proposed that uses the real-time and historical data from end users to find the best allocation at a user. Second, it studies the impact of trust relationship between computing entities to prevent the unauthorized accesses and provides an authentication procedure. Third, it describes a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm that consists of cooperative agents and aims to find the best resource allocation strategy by minimizing task processing latency. We validate the proposed DT-empowered architecture to show the reduced processing latency compared to traditional benchmark methods.","2694-2941","979-8-3503-3307-7","10.1109/ICCWorkshops57953.2023.10283649","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10283649","","6G mobile communication;Conferences;Wireless networks;Authentication;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Digital twins","","5","","15","IEEE","23 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the realm of software development, software architecture holds paramount importance because it serves as a guiding force to shape the entire life cycle of a software system. Software architecture is a foundation for complex digital components built upon a software system. Within this domain, two prevalent paradigms, monolithic and service-oriented architecture (SOA), stand distinct. While monolithic simplifies development using its integrated structure, SOA reduces complexity through modular services. However, both paradigms suffer severe scalability, development cycle, and flexibility challenges. Subsequently, microservice architecture as a modern paradigm emerges to overcome these challenges. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the paradigm shift from monolithic to microservice architecture. It begins with exploring the monolithic and SOA conceptual landscape and their pros and cons. After that, we delve into the microservice platform, including its basic architecture and implementation stages. Furthermore, we provide the trend of the paradigm shift that highlights the recent developments in the field and identifies the research challenges associated with it.

A shared control takes advantage of human and computer strengths in decision-making support, and this helps to improve the adaptability, agility, reliability, responsiveness, and resilience of the system. Since the decision spaces for human thinking and machine intelligence are quite different, challenges occur to fuse human intelligence and machine intelligence effectively. A brain–computer interface (BCI) can bridge human and machine intelligence; however, traditional BCIs are unidirectional that support interaction in one of two scenarios: first, human or machine takes effect at different control layers, and second, either human or machine takes effect at a time. There is an emerging need to close the loop of BCI-based control to alleviate the adverse effects of a machine's error or a human's mistake. In this article, available technologies for acquisition, processing, and mining of brain signals are reviewed, the needs of integrating human's capability to control unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are elaborated, and research challenges in advancing BCI for a shared human and machine control are discussed at the aspects of data acquisition, mapping of human's and machine's decision spaces, and the fusion of human's and machine's intelligence in automated controls. To address unsolved problems in the aforementioned aspects, we proposed a new platform of using BCI for human–machine interactions and three innovations are, first, an advanced BCI to acquire multimodal brain signals and extract features related to the intentions of motion and the quantified human's affection, second, an arbitrating mechanism in system control to determine the weight of human's decisions based on quantified human's affection, and finally, a decision support system that is capable of fusing human's and machine's decisions from different decision spaces seamlessly in controlling a UAV for real-time performance in application.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2024.3368402","Indiana Space Grant Consortium; Harris Chair in Wireless Communications and Applied Research at Purdue University Fort Wayne; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10443445","","Autonomous aerial vehicles;Reliability;Robots;Brain-computer interfaces;Accidents;Machine intelligence;Uncertainty","","1","","77","IEEE","22 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the postwar years, these questions were debated by Alan Turing and Douglas Hartree, who differed in their interpretations of the digital computer as a new piece of science and technology. Hartree emphasized its unprecedented calculation speed and envisioned applications in physics, logistics, energy, and warfare. Turing, who envisioned applications in biology and cognition, emphasized its potential to outperform humans intellectually, including capabilities considered distinctly human, which Hartree downplayed by mobilizing the notes of Ada Lovelace.

However, Data Loss Prevention (DLP) is an import problem need to be solved. Especially, in the Vehicle Sharing System (VSS), the data authority is hard to be guaranteed based on the current technology. VSS provides the users with a convenient way to access vehicles nearby. However, the driving data security which can be used to record the driving conditions cannot be guaranteed by either cloud server or the vehicle. The camera in the cab is also not accepted because it will leak the user's privacy. This article solves this problem based on the cryptography with the public auditing technology. We design a multi-signature scheme so that the OBU and the PDA equipment of the vehicle renter can jointly sign a signature as a meta data for the driving information and upload it to the cloud server together with the raw data. In the event of a dispute, such as a vehicle accident, anyone can conduct an integrity checking with batch jobs on the stored data in the cloud server, so that the cloud and the vehicle renter cannot deny these information. We think that our scheme can be used to prevent some obvious data modification in cloud or as a part of the reference for accident identification. We also use the provable security technology to prove that our protocol is secure, and we realize its core algorithms. The experimental result shows that our scheme is efficient.","1939-9359","","10.1109/TVT.2023.3281728","Nanjing University of Finance and Economics YouthScholar Support Program(grant numbers:L-SXW19002); Nanjing University of Finance and Economics Doctoral Fund(grant numbers:L-SXW20001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10195993","VANET;cloud security;cryptographic protocol;public auditing;integrity checking","Vehicular ad hoc networks;Servers;Security;Cloud computing;Data privacy;Industries;Clouds","","","","39","IEEE","27 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many researchers believe that good Summer camps can improve many students' educational and career development outcomes. Teachers and administrators are increasingly promoting Summer camp opportunities for introducing programming skills to middle and high school students. The motivation of our program is to offer hands-on projects for middle and high school students to increase their interests and knowledge in computing to meet the growing demand. Like some Summer coding camps, we picked Scratch as the programming language (designed and offered for free by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for the students to learn important mathematical and computer programming concepts. In addition, the students learn how to think and reason creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively, while also having fun during the one-week Summer camp. For the students already familiar with Scratch, the instructor exposed students to basic concepts of Java programming language, such as Java virtual machine, computer memory, data representation, primitive data types, casting, arithmetic, and relational operators, as well as the assignment, selection and printing statements. This article presents our findings from Summer camps organized in 2018 and 2022. Our conclusion is that all students showed a better understanding of programming concepts and confidence in computing. In the upcoming paper sections, we will describe details about how we made one-week camps to be unique compared to other similar camps. One element of our own approach is to teach in an effective and innovative using an interactive teaching approach. For example, when we designed the lecture notes, we imagine that we are students taking for the first time a computer programming course. In addition, we designed simple programming exercises for the students to solve immediately. The instructors and Teaching Assistants promptly checked the solution and award the students with stars for completing the work. This environment was very well received because it was viewed as a student collegiate competition instead of a race against time. Besides learning about computer programming, we adopted during Summer camps several strategies like those enumerated earlier to enrich our camps, as well as social events, career and professional development, and academic exposure. Our findings indicate that these additional activities proved to be beneficial to our students attending the Summer camps.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342945","Computing;Scratch and Java programming languages;Summer Camp","Printing;Java;Computer languages;Casting;Career development;Engineering profession;Stars","","","","19","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to identify new information inside databases, it is necessary to apply strategies and procedures taken from a variety of information systems specializations. The practice of data mining entails not only the finding of new information but also the extraction of information that may be put to beneficial use. In recent years, considerable advances have been made in decision-making abilities in a variety of contexts, including expert systems, artificial agent networks, and machine intelligence. These businesses include companies in the fields of commerce, education, architecture, and building construction, among others. The approach that was taken in this piece was derived from an analysis of the data mining strategies and developments that have seen the greatest amount of adoption across a variety of business sectors over the course of the last five years. These patterns and modes of operation were investigated. Throughout the course of this enquiry, the processes and patterns described above were scrutinized. The use of text mining as a tool for database analysis, the enhancement of worker productivity in the industrial sector, and the application of data mining for instructional practices are only a few instances of what has been learnt in the area of education.

The core technology is path planning. The existing methods have limited ability to deal with complex environment, low search efficiency, unsmooth path, easy to trap local optimum, and lack of real-time performance. Intelligent algorithm is a better method to solve this problem. Because the A * algorithm has strong search ability, clear algorithm thinking, and can be constrained to the global optimal path, it has the advantages of high efficiency, stability and optimality. Therefore, a motion trajectory planning method based on A * algorithm is proposed for mobile robots. Firstly, this paper analyzes several commonly used mobile robot path planning algorithms, and selects the A * algorithm as the object of this study. Secondly, the working principle, advantages and disadvantages of the A * algorithm are introduced in detail, as well as the design modules of the A * algorithm. Then, the problem of motion trajectory planning for mobile robots is analyzed and a solution is proposed. Aiming at the problems of low planning efficiency, turning path, sharp and unsmooth path, the efficiency and stability of A * algorithm are optimized by adding heuristic algorithm, corner optimization and path smoothing. Finally, the working environment of the mobile robot is established by using the grid method, and the path planning simulation experiment is carried out on the MATLAB platform. The experimental results show that the method of path planning using A * algorithm is effective and has a wide application prospect.","","979-8-3503-7227-4","10.1109/ICICR61203.2024.00042","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10659792","Mobile robot;Path planning;A * algorithm;Grid method;MATLAB","Smoothing methods;Service robots;Trajectory planning;Heuristic algorithms;Power system stability;Stability analysis;Real-time systems","","","","18","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve this problem, many multi-scale feature fusion networks have been proposed to improve multi-scale target detection accuracy by fusing fine-grained information from shallow networks and semantic information from deep networks. This approach requires the introduction of extraÂ parameters. Thinking from another perspective, can the accuracy of multi-scale target detection be improved by fusing the feature information under different receptive fields? For this purpose, we designed a three-layer network structure called Trident-LK Net. our model uses convolutional kernels of different sizes (31, 25, 1) in the feature extraction phase and establishes cross-fusion connections. This omits the feature fusion part and greatly reduces the network parameters while obtaining a good detection accuracy. Finally we perform experiments on the neu-det dataset and the gc10 dataset to verify the feasibility of our idea. While keeping the number of parameters to a minimum, our model achieves competitive detection results on the neu-det dataset (76.9% mAP) and optimal on the gc10 dataset (63.55% mAP).

Therefore, the forward DNN (the pattern recognition system in this paper) attracts attention to the necessity of interpreting the results obtained by DNN. To preserve the high performance of DNN, we focus on a post-hoc explanation; this approach means building an explainable model for the decision obtained by the black box. To avoid the interpretation of a set of millions of non-linear functions, we divide DNN into two parts: the feature extractor and the classifier. Following that, we argue for a specific interpretation of each of them. While for classifiers, we have several suitable explainable models (and we decided on the fuzzy logical function), we believe that feature interpretation is a creative scientific activity corresponding to the usual research.

Depth-separable convolution was adopted instead of standard convolution, reducing the number of network parameters by  $2\times 10 ^{6}$  and increasing detection speed by 23%. Introducing BiFPN feature pyramid structure with fusion of different feature layers in neck network improves detection accuracy by 0.4%. Adding CBAM attention mechanism at the prediction end improves the feature extraction ability of the model for small target images, which further improves the detection accuracy by 0.5%. The loss function CIoU was improved to Focal EIoU in order to solve the problems of unbalanced sample datasets and vanishing IoU gradients during the training process. The experimental results exhibit that the improved algorithm achieves an average accuracy of 98.5% on the dataset, a 39% enchancment in model detection speed and a 28% reduction in model parameters, verifying that the algorithm has the advantages of high recognition accuracy and fast detection speed. It can effectively solve the technical difficulties in the detection of defects in the existing contact network suspension chords, and provides a new way of thinking for intelligent railway inspection.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3322444","Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province(grant numbers:A2022210024); Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12072205); Graduate Innovation Fund of Shijiazhuang Tiedao University(grant numbers:YC2023027); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10273694","YOLOv5;lightweight network;image detection;railway;deep learning","Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Deep learning;Rail transportation;Training;Predictive models;Computational efficiency;YOLO","","1","","34","CCBYNCND","6 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blockchain improves device safety by transforming access management, storing credentials on a tamper-resistant ledger, mitigating the risk of unauthorized access and giving a robust defence against malevolent actors. Integrating DL into this framework also raises safety measures, as it permits devices to inspect and regulate to develop attacks distinctly. DL models accurately recognize intricate designs and anomalies, allowing the technique to distinguish and threaten possible attacks in real time. The fusion of BC and DL not only improves the reliability of user electronics but also establishes a dynamic and adaptive safety system, enhancing consumer confidence in the safety of their devices. Therefore, this study presents a BC-Based Access Management with DL Threat Modeling (BCAM-DLTM) technique for securing consumer electronics devices in the IoT ecosystems. The BCAM-DLTM technique mainly follows a two-phase procedure: access management and threat detection. Moreover, BC technology can be applied to the access management of consumer electronics devices. Besides, the BCAM-DLTM technique applies a deep belief networks (DBNs) model for proficiently identifying threats. To enhance the recognition results of the DBN model, the hyperparameter tuning procedure uses the reptile search algorithm (RSA). The experimental outcome study of the BCAM-DLTM approach employs the NSLKDD dataset. The comprehensive results of the BCAM-DLTM approach portrayed a superior accuracy outcome of 99.63% over existing models in terms of distinct metrics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3441094","Deanship of Research and Graduate Studies at King Khalid University for funding this work through Large Research Project(grant numbers:RGP2/43/45); Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers(grant numbers:PNURSP2024R411); Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; Deanship of Scientific Research at Northern Border University, Arar, KSA for funding this research work through the project number(grant numbers:NBU-FFR-2024-3030-03); Future University in Egypt (FUE); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10632117","Blockchain;Internet of Things;deep learning;reptile search algorithm;deep belief network","Biological system modeling;Safety;Consumer electronics;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Threat modeling;Ecosystems;Blockchains;Deep learning;Search methods;Evidence theory","","","","40","CCBYNCND","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In response, there has been growing attention in research and practice emphasizing pre-college groups. This is partly because of the growing recognition-reflected in initiatives like CS4ALL, Code.org, Bootstrap: Data Science, Exploring Computer Science-that learning experiences before college are consequential in sustaining a robust pipeline of computer scientists and engineers. Despite these inroads, there is justifiable concern that existing efforts might not fully support learner development in the necessary conceptual, epistemological, and heuristic styles needed to productively parse and understand “big data.” This is because computing-based curricula that include data science often involve data curated by others (rather than learners directly), which results in simulated versions of practice instead of engagement that is realistically discursive and messy. This is further complicated by the persistent shortage of K-12 computer science teachers in general and even fewer who can design and implement curricula that support authentic engagement with data science. To address these issues, we leverage culturally relevant and constructionist perspectives in a sandbox (i.e., open-ended) science where tools like Scratch and electronic textiles (E-textiles) have had success expanding possibilities in computing to also include activities where learners can engage broadly along varied pursuits-and encounter challenges that spur computational thinking and problem-solving. The literature suggests that learning activities framed in this way encourage knowledge construction, practice literacies, and seriously impact learner attitudes, interest, and perceptions of growth in the field. This latter set of self-concept measures represents a few of many related key predictors of long-term field participation and persistence. In this work-in-progress scholarship of discovery research, we co-develop, with youth and educators, “Coding Like a Data Miner” (CLDM)-a sandbox approach to computing-based data science wherein learners access a social media platform, Twitter, to mine, analyze, and understand quantitative and qualitative data sources. In this preliminary work, we assess affordances in co-developing a curriculum that leverages sandbox approaches to data science. Ultimately (and what will be presented in our final submission), we aim to study learning outcomes when high school students' access, analyze and make sense of “big data” sets of their own. We collaborated with high school teachers in a West Texas/Paso Del Norte region where computer science educators are exceptionally scarce and where there is an urgent and persistent need to support underrepresented learner access to burgeoning areas of computing. Using mixed-methodological approaches (e.g., quantitative analysis of learner pre- and post-survey responses along with qualitative assessments of semi-structured interview data), we address the following research questions: (1) What affordances exist using co-design approaches to develop sandbox data science for pre-college learners? (2) Which computational concepts do students learn when carrying out CLDM activities, (3) Which computational practices do high school students enact when mining, processing, and analyzing big data sets in CLDM? (4) How do learner knowledge and perceptions about data science shift after participating in CLDM? We use contemporary perspectives in computing education, constructionism, and equity to discuss how open-ended sandbox approaches to computing-based data science support learner computational thinking, practice literacies, and field perceptions.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343283","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:2137708); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343283","Computer Science Education;Data Science Education;Constructionism;Curriculum Design;Computer Science Learning","Computer science;Smart textiles;Social networking (online);Statistical analysis;Affordances;Soft sensors;Scholarships","","","","19","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we take the initiative to explore and propose a unified framework called PointMeta, to which the popular 3D point cloud analysis approaches could fit. This brings three benefits. First, it allows us to compare different approaches in a fair manner, and use quick experiments to verify any empirical observations or assumptions summarized from the comparison. Second, the big picture brought by PointMeta enables us to think across different components, and revisit common beliefs and key design decisions made by the popular approaches. Third, based on the learnings from the previous two analyses, by doing simple tweaks on the existing approaches, we are able to derive a basic building block, termed PointMetaBase. It shows very strong performance in efficiency and effectiveness through extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, and thus verifies the necessity and benefits of high-level interpretation, contrast, and comparison like PointMeta. In particular, PointMetaBase surpasses the previous state-of-the-art method by 0.7%/1.4/%2.1% mIoU with only 2%/11%/13% of the computation cost on the S3DIS datasets.

However, these CNN-based methods require considerable computation and complexity, making it impossible for these methods to perform real-time calculations in edge devices. Thus, lightweight model design has become a development trend in the super-resolution field, including pruning, quantization, and other methods. The 1-bit quantization is an extreme lightweight method which can reduce the calculation amount of the model in an extreme manner and is friendly to hardware such as edge devices. Most existing binary quantization approaches lead to a large information loss during forward propagation, especially in detailed color information (e.g., edge, texture, and contrast). The loss of color information makes modern binary methods unsuitable for SISR tasks. We think the loss occurs because these methods typically utilize a uniform threshold to quantize the weights and activations. Thus, in this article, we thoroughly analyze the difference between normal classification tasks and SISR tasks, and present a binarization scheme based on local means. The proposed method can maintain more detailed information in feature maps using dynamic thresholds during quantization. Specifically, each value in the full precision activations has a corresponding threshold during the quantization process, and those thresholds are determined by the full precision values of the surroundings. In addition, a gradient approximator is introduced to adaptively optimize the gradient for updating binary weights. We then verify the effectiveness of our method for training binary networks on several SISR benchmarks including VDSR and SRResNet. Experimental results show that the proposed method can outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms to obtain binary networks for image super-resolution with better peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values and visual quality.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2022.3212827","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018AAA0103202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62176195,61922066,61876142,62036007,62206211,61976166); Technology Innovation Leading Program of Shaanxi(grant numbers:2022QFY01-15,2021GY-030); Open Research Projects of Zhejiang Laboratory(grant numbers:2021KG0AB01); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Innovation Fund of Xidian University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9927310","Binary neural network (BNN);local means;super resolution (SR)","Superresolution;Quantization (signal);Task analysis;Convolution;Training;Computational modeling;Visualization","","5","","58","IEEE","21 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both real-world and synthetic data.

The core operation in GNNs is the message propagation in which each node updates its information by aggregating the information from its neighbors. Existing GNNs usually adopt either linear neighborhood aggregation (e.g. mean, sum) or max aggregator in their message propagation. 1) For linear aggregators, the whole nonlinearity and network's capacity of GNNs are generally limited because deeper GNNs usually suffer from the over-smoothing issue due to their inherent information propagation mechanism. Also, linear aggregators are usually vulnerable to the spatial perturbations. 2) For max aggregator, it usually fails to be aware of the detailed information of node representations within neighborhood. To overcome these issues, we re-think the message propagation mechanism in GNNs and develop the new general nonlinear aggregators for neighborhood information aggregation in GNNs. One main aspect of our nonlinear aggregators is that they all provide the optimally balanced aggregator between max and mean/sum aggregators. Thus, they can inherit both i) high nonlinearity that enhances network's capacity, robustness and ii) detail-sensitivity that is aware of the detailed information of node representations in GNNs’ message propagation. Promising experiments show the effectiveness, high capacity and robustness of the proposed methods.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2023.3290649","New Generation of AI(grant numbers:2018AAA0100400); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076004); Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province(grant numbers:2108085Y23); Anhui Provincial Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2022i01020014); University Synergy Innovation Program of Anhui Province(grant numbers:GXXT-2022-032); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10168286","Graph neural networks;graph representation learning;message passing;nonlinear message aggregation","Task analysis;Robustness;Message passing;Computer architecture;Computational modeling;Training;Smoothing methods","","1","","44","IEEE","29 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Unlearning Descartes: Sentient AI is a Political Problem","G. Hull","School of Data Science, UNC Charlotte, Charlotte, NC, USA",Journal of Social Computing,"28 Dec 2023","2023","4","3","193","204","The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has renewed debate about whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be conscious or sentient. This paper identifies two approaches to the topic and argues: (1) A “Cartesian” approach treats consciousness, sentience, and personhood as very similar terms, and treats language use as evidence that an entity is conscious. This approach, which has been dominant in AI research, is primarily interested in what consciousness is, and whether an entity possesses it. (2) An alternative “Hobbesian” approach treats consciousness as a sociopolitical issue and is concerned with what the implications are for labeling something sentient or conscious. This both enables a political disambiguation of language, consciousness, and personhood and allows regulation to proceed in the face of intractable problems in deciding if something “really is” sentient. (3) AI systems should not be treated as conscious, for at least two reasons: (a) treating the system as an origin point tends to mask competing interests in creating it, at the expense of the most vulnerable people involved; and (b) it will tend to hinder efforts at holding someone accountable for the behavior of the systems. A major objective of this paper is accordingly to encourage a shift in thinking. In place of the Cartesian question—is AI sentient?—I propose that we confront the more Hobbesian one: Does it make sense to regulate developments in which AI systems behave as if they were sentient?","2688-5255","","10.23919/JSC.2023.0020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10375936","artificial intelligence;Large Language Model;consciousness;sentience;personhood;Descartes;Hobbes","Sociotechnical systems;Social computing;Computational modeling;Resists;Manuals;Regulation;Labeling","","1","","67","","28 Dec 2023","","","TUP","TUP Journals"

Since the objective of tumor segmentation is to predict the pixels that comprise the actual tumor, image cropping was performed in order to focus more on the brain and the tumor and not on the background. This conjecture was tested using state-of-the-art models namely 2D U-Net, 2D U- Net with VGG19 as backbone, 2D U-Net with InceptionV3 ad backbone, and 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone. Three different configurations were designed for this purpose. The first configuration used resized images while the second configuration used cropped images. The third configuration used pretrained weights of models of trained on the resized images and then applied them on the cropped images. Overall, the top three models are 2D U-Net with InceptionResNetV2 as backbone trained using the resized images followed by 2D U-Net trained also using the resized images and then finally by 2D U-Net trained using the cropped images.

The current medical image segmentation model mainstream uses standard convolution and Transformers as the most important components of the model. However, standard convolution is unable to handle the problems of remote information interaction and long distance spatial dependence. Transformers is a hindrance to its application when dealing with medical clinical data, the insufficient amount of data and the large memory and time required for computation are hindering factors. Recently, HorNet, a high-order spatial interaction model that performs well in natural scenarios, has drawn our attention because the high-order interaction model has the common advantages of both convolution and Transformers. In this paper, we propose a new system that uses the HorNet model, which performs well in natural scenes, for medical image segmentation (skin lesion segmentation). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use a higher-order interaction model for medical image segmentation. We validate our system on three public datasets and do external validation on our own clinical dataset. The experimental results show that our system outperforms other current medical image segmentation models in several metrics. We think this is due to the higher spatial interaction capability and larger perceptual domain of gnconv in HorNet, which can fully and comprehensively capture the information of the overall medical image, which is crucial for medical image processing.","","979-8-3503-5878-0","10.1109/MedAI59581.2023.00066","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:82273514); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10403173","Computer-aided diagnosis;Deep Learning;Higher-order spatial interaction;Skin lesion segmentation;Au-tomatic segmentation","Image segmentation;Convolution;Computational modeling;Transformers;Skin;Lesions;Medical diagnostic imaging","","","","26","IEEE","31 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an ARIMA model and a BP neural network model based on the WOA are developed to perform in-depth data mining on Wordle. For model I, this paper uses ARIMA model fitting to fit the trend of the total number of historical report results over time, and obtains the R2 of the model as 0.986. Based on this, this paper establishes a prediction model for the interval of the total number of reports, and gives the prediction interval of the total number of report results on March 1, 2023 as [21211], [21814]. For Model II, this paper defines word attributes as the following four indicators: for example, the commonness of the word, the number of occurrences of the same letter in the word. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the percentage of reported scores to the total reported scores in the Hard mode and the word attributes was calculated. Finally, in the Hard model, the percentage of reported scores out of the total reported scores was significantly correlated with how common the word was and whether it began with a vowel letter. For Model III, this paper constructed a BP Neural network model based on WOA, which, in this paper, uses word attributes as the input layer and the report distribution of words as the output layer. In the WOA, the optimal weights and thresholds of the BP neural network are obtained in this paper by continuous search and approximation. The final model has a Mean Absolute Error value of 0.38, both of which have good performance. At the same time, this paper predicts the results of “EERIE”, and the obtained distribution results are rounded to [1], [7], [20], [22], [21], [19], [10]. Through the above modelling and calculation, this paper mines Wordle's user data, which has some theoretical significance for the healthy development of Wordle.","","979-8-3503-1467-0","10.1109/ICIPCA59209.2023.10257974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10257974","Wordle;number of reports;ARIMA;word attributes;BP Neural network model","Computational modeling;Image processing;Neural networks;Fitting;Games;Predictive models;Market research","","","","10","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The one-stage object detection model directly completes object detection through a single forward propagation and has fast real-time object detection capabilities, making it widely used—especially the model of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) series. Improving the detection accuracy of the YOLO model has always been a research topic. The gradient architecture cascades feature information extraction and aggregates all features at the end, which can improve the feature fusion ability of the network. Combining the idea of gradient architecture, this paper proposes a YOLO based on gradient architecture: Gradient-YOLO. Specifically, this paper integrates gradient architecture into the backbone, neck, and bottleneck structures in the YOLO network, obtaining gradient backbone, gradient neck, and gradient bottleneck, respectively. By combining gradient architecture, various network parts in Gradient-YOLO can fully aggregate multi-layer features, reduce feature loss, and thus improve detection accuracy. This paper takes the mature YOLOv5 model and the latest YOLOv8 model as the baseline and combines gradient thinking to obtain Gradient-YOLOv5 and GradientYOLOv8. Moreover, conduct experimental testing on the MS COCO dataset. Regarding the mAP@.5 detection indicator, compared to YOLOv5s, Gradient-YOLOv5s increased by 5.07%. Compared to YOLOv8n, Gradient-YOLOv8n has increased by 4.63%.

These models provide intelligent solutions that are closer to human thinking, enabling us to use general artificial intelligence (AI) to solve problems in various applications. However, in the field of remote sensing (RS), the scientific literature on the implementation of AGI remains relatively scant. Existing AI-related research in RS focuses primarily on visual-understanding tasks while neglecting the semantic understanding of the objects and their relationships. This is where vision-LMs (VLMs) excel as they enable reasoning about images and their associated textual descriptions, allowing for a deeper understanding of the underlying semantics. VLMs can go beyond visual recognition of RS images and can model semantic relationships as well as generate natural language descriptions of the image. This makes them better suited for tasks that require both visual and textual understanding, such as image captioning and visual question answering (VQA). This article provides a comprehensive review of the research on VLMs in RS, summarizing the latest progress, highlighting current challenges, and identifying potential research opportunities. Specifically, we review the application of VLMs in mainstream RS tasks, including image captioning, text-based image generation, text-based image retrieval (TBIR), VQA, scene classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. For each task, we analyze representative works and discuss research progress. Finally, we summarize the limitations of existing works and provide possible directions for future development.

In this paper, we are inspired by the human recognition and learning pattern and propose VideoDistill, a framework with language-aware (i.e., goal-driven) behavior in both vision perception and answer generation. VideoDistill generates answers only from question-related visual embeddings and follows a thinking-observing-answering approach that closely resembles human behavior, distinguishing it from previous research. Specifically, we develop a language-aware gating mechanism to replace the standard cross-attention, avoiding language's direct fusion into visual representations. We incorporate this mechanism into two key components of the entire framework. The first component is a differentiable sparse sampling module, which selects frames containing the necessary dynamics and semantics relevant to the questions. The second component is a vision refinement module that merges existing spatial-temporal attention layers to ensure extracting multi-grained visual semantics associated with the questions. We conduct evaluations on various challenging video question-answering benchmarks, and VideoDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance in both general and long-form VideoQA datasets.

We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pretrained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background.

Each and every second, a vast amount of information is produced online because of social media sites. However, online reviews on social media provides an excellent and trustworthy channel for examining the areas that require improvement and for understanding the needs of customers. This paper tries to understand the various topics that are discussed by customers about food with the aim of providing an insight to improve the area where there are negative comments. By doing this, customer retention will increase and gradually the business also. Topic modeling is done to find the hidden topic in a set of comments or customer reviews to find out on which topic customers are talking, thinking, or discussing more about restaurant services. It helps to read customers' mindsets, and accordingly, improvements can be made to increase consumer demand for a restaurant. So, a system is proposed to detect topics of textual reviews of different restaurants using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) modelling approach. A probabilistic, statistical strategy for document designing called latent document analysis (LDA) identifies latent semantic topics in sizable corpora. The dataset used for this study was taken from Kaggle, which had 111,105 reviews. First, topics from reviews were extracted using the LDA model, then data was visualised using the LDAvis tool.

This leads to the thinking of how real intelligence could be created. Consciousness theories believe that general intelligence is essentially conscious, yet no universal definition is agreed upon. In this work, global workspace (GW) theory is implemented and integrated with crucial cognitive components. With the focus on episodic memory and inspiration from the nature of episodic memory in psychology and neuroscience, the episodic memory component is implemented within the GW framework. In our experiment, the robotic agent operates in a real-world interactive context, forming episodic memory and demonstrating static, temporal, and context memory capabilities during interactions. Consciousness in this work engages in all formation, maintenance, and retrieval processes of episodic memory. The novelty and contributions of this work are: 1) this work is implementing episodic memory within the consciousness framework, suggesting the sustainable potential of such an integrated approach to cognitive agents with artificial general intelligence (AGI); 2) regarding the limited examples in consciousness-based cognitive architectures, this work attempts to contribute to the diversity of perspectives and approaches; 3) extant episodic memory implementations are suffering from various limitations, while this work summarises some key features for modeling episodic memory within a cognitive architecture; and 4) authors discuss the relationship between episodic memory, consciousness, and general intelligence, proposing the compatibility and relationship between machine consciousness and other AGI research. It is believed that a better alignment between them would further boost the fusion of diverse research for achieving desired cognitive machines.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2023.3266103","European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme(grant numbers:952324); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10099445","Cognitive robots;consciousness;episodic memory;general intelligence;global workspace (GW)","Cognition;Psychology;Computational modeling;Deep learning;Cognitive robotics;Task analysis;Maintenance engineering","","","","58","IEEE","11 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are a variety of approaches that can be utilized in order to package and present these viruses. Some of them can be immediately identified as malicious based on the content of the body, the sender, who may or may not be trustworthy, and the subject lines, which are just unintelligible. It may be difficult for receivers to identify individual email messages that include malware since the malicious actor puts a lot of effort into making it appear as though the email message was sent from a respectable sender. Phishing is an attempt to steal sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy entity, typically a business. Cybersecurity is an extremely important topic in the field of information technology. Information security is one of the most pressing problems facing our generation at the moment. When we think of cyber security, the first thing that comes to mind is cybercrime, which is expanding at an alarming rate. This is because cybercrime is the most common kind of online crime. In order to put an end to these cybercrimes, various governments and businesses are pursuing a variety of preventative measures. In spite of the many safeguards in place, a significant number of people continue to be anxious about the safety of their online activity. The difficulties surrounding the use of email viruses as a threat to cyber security are the primary focus of this article.

In order to detect 4mC sites, we develop a multiview learning method for achieving more effectively via merging multiple feature spaces. Furthermore, we think about whether the multiview learning method can improve the across species classification ability by fusing data of multiple species. In our study, we propose a multiview Laplacian kernel sparse representation-based classifier, called MvLapKSRC-HSIC. First, we make use of three feature extraction methods [position-specific trinucleotide propensity, nucleotide chemical property, and DNA physicochemical properties) to extract the DNA sequence features. MvLapKSRC-HSIC uses a kernel sparse representation-based classifier with graph regularization. In order to maintain the independence between various views, we add a multiview regularization term constructed by Hilbert–Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC). In the experiments, MvLapKSRC-HSIC is applied on six datasets, so as to compare with other popular methods in single-species and cross-species experiments. All experimental results show that MvLapKSRC-HSIC is superior to other outstanding methods on both single species and cross species. Importantly, MvLapKSRC-HSIC can identify a series of potential DNA 4mC sites, which have not yet been experimentally evaluate on multiple species and merit further research.","2691-4581","","10.1109/TAI.2022.3187060","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62172296,62172076,61902271,61972280); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFC2100700); Academy of Finland(grant numbers:336033,315896); Business Finland(grant numbers:884/31/2018); EU H2020(grant numbers:101016775); Natural Science Research of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions of China(grant numbers:19KJB520014); Municipal Government of Quzhou(grant numbers:2020D003,2021D004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9809784","DNA N4-methylcytosine (4mC) sites;kernel method;multiview learning;sequence classification;sparse representation-based classifier (SRC)","DNA;Kernel;Feature extraction;Training;Laplace equations;Learning systems;Support vector machines","","5","","54","CCBY","28 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, further consideration of the heterogeneous behavior of competitors and their impact on the evolution of conflicts deserves special attention. Usually, DMs' evaluation thinking has certain ambiguity and uncertainty, and they are accustomed to giving qualitative evaluation information. Given the unique advantages of trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TrIT2FS) in the fusion of decision domains and transformational linguistic expressions, this paper constructs a theoretical framework for a graph model on TrIT2FS and proposes a method for calculating DMs preference ranking and a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function. Firstly, the DMs will consider multiple factors in the decision evaluation process, and there are specific regret avoidance psychological behavior characteristics; thus, this paper integrates VIKOR and regret theory to solve the DM's preference ranking and expands on a new preference ranking method. Secondly, mixed stability definitions based on TrIT2FS are proposed to facilitate the description of different sanctioning behaviors of heterogeneous opponents. Subsequently, a heterogeneous combinatorial foresight stability function is proposed to quickly obtain conflict evolution solutions in complex dynamic conflict problems based on the extended mixed stability definitions. Finally, to thoroughly test the correctness and practicality of the proposed theory, the conflict between inputs and outputs of the technological transformation of enterprises under the low-carbon strategy is used as a specific application scenario and example for validation.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2024.3451159","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654535","Graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR);trapezoidal interval type-2 fuzzy sets (TrIT2FS);regret theory;VIKOR;heterogeneous opponents;combinatorial foresight","Stability analysis;Thermal stability;Linguistics;Decision making;Uncertainty;Psychology;Mathematical models","","","","","IEEE","28 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

In this letter, we propose a tactile-based in-hand object perception approach, empowered by a sim-to-real approach toward a data-efficient learning process. A high-fidelity tactile input, measured by a pair of vision-based tactile sensors, was represented as a point cloud facilitating dual functionality of object classification and the associated pose estimation. For the classification, we constructed PoinTacNet, a variation of PointNet to fit into tactile data processing. A reliable simulation methodology on tactile input was employed for the pretraining of the model, transferred to the fine-tuning process facing real tactile data. Taking inspiration from human behaviors, a re-grasping strategy was imparted by means of conditional accumulation of class likelihood distribution. The result of the framework facilitates a high object classification accuracy of 83.89$\%$ on the ten objects from McMaster-Carr's CAD models, which is significantly improved by the re-grasping. In addition, a set of benchmarks displays the computational efficiency in the sim-to-real transfer. In line with the successful classification, the posture of in-hand objects is estimated using point cloud registration algorithms, achieving an average angular and translational RMSE of 5.03$^\circ$ and 2.41 mm, respectively.

Prevailing works treat these tasks as distinct tasks, leading to the development of task-specific models tailored to individual datasets. However, we posit that the presence of visual relationships can furnish crucial contextual and intricate relational cues that significantly augment the inference of human-object interactions. This motivates us to think if there is a natural intrinsic relationship between the two tasks, where scene graphs can serve as a source for inferring human-object interactions. In light of this, we introduce SG2HOI+, a unified one-step model based on the Transformer architecture. Our approach employs two interactive hierarchical Transformers to seamlessly unify the tasks of SGG and HOI detection. Concretely, we initiate a relation Transformer tasked with generating relation triples from a suite of visual features. Subsequently, we employ another transformer-based decoder to predict human-object interactions based on the generated relation triples. A comprehensive series of experiments conducted across established benchmark datasets including Visual Genome, V-COCO, and HICO-DET demonstrates the compelling performance of our SG2HOI+ model in comparison to prevalent one-stage SGG models. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art HOI methods. Additionally, we observe that our SG2HOI+ jointly trained on both SGG and HOI tasks in an end-to-end manner yields substantial improvements for both tasks compared to individualized training paradigms.","1941-0042","","10.1109/TIP.2023.3330304","DARPA Assured Neuro Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (ANSR) Program(grant numbers:FA8750-23-2-1016); DARPA Knowledge Management at Scale and Speed (KMASS) Program(grant numbers:HR00112220047); DARPA Computational Cultural Understanding (CCU) Program(grant numbers:HR001122C0029); NSFC(grant numbers:62306064); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10315051","Scene graph generation;human-object interaction;one-stage network;multi-tasks training","Task analysis;Visualization;Transformers;Training;Semantics;Predictive models;Multitasking","Humans;Benchmarking","1","","63","IEEE","10 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Enculturation can be understood as the process by which students are assimilated into the engineering culture. This culture involves the base knowledge, practices, and values shared by the community of practicing engineers. Both the culture and its assimilation are somewhat obscure and often attributed to role-modeling and hidden curriculum. Nevertheless, undergraduate students are expected to undergo this assimilation process, and by the end of a five-year program, they behave, talk, and do what engineers do. An approach to this process is the well-established model of engineering identity. This model of identity, however, limits its scope to the intrinsic process occurring in the student without paying much attention to the support systems expected to welcome and nurture students into the profession. Enculturation is a relatively new model that proposes both intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting this assimilation of students. During the Spring of 2022, a team of researchers at a U.S. Southwest institution applied a survey to operationalize the extrinsic factors of a recently outlined engineering model of enculturation to understand the impact of COVID on engineering students. Eight Likert-based questions were asked to 534 engineering undergraduate students at different school year classifications (e.g., sophomore, junior, or senior). The model of enculturation tested eight extrinsic factors involving (1) engineering design, (2) teamwork, (3) engineering profession, (4) ethics, (5) engineering communications, (6) mathematical/physical modeling, (7) problem-solving, and (8) algorithmic/computational thinking. Additional Likert-based questions asked students about the perceived impact of COVID on their educational experience. The research questions guiding their investigation were: (a) How are the dimensions of enculturation to engineering changing across engineering undergraduate classifications?, and (b) How is enculturation associated with the COVID impact on students? Preliminary results show that six of the factors (namely 1–5 and 7) increase by students' school classification. This means that students in the lower years of their undergraduate program perceive their enculturation, as portrayed by factors 1–5 & 7, less than students at more advanced stages of their program. In terms of the perceived impact of COVID, only two factors showed negative correlations with this perceived impact The factors were ethics and algorithmic/computational thinking. In other words, the worse the student's perception of COVID's impact on their educational experience, the less they endorsed their enculturation in the impact of society of their technical solutions and their use of programming languages. While these results show encouraging applicability of the enculturation model, it can only be considered a first approach to a more fully developed model. The researchers expect to engage the FIE community in a discussion leading to a more refined enculturation model.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343256","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343256","Enculturation to engineering;COVID impact;curriculum","COVID-19;Surveys;Knowledge engineering;Ethics;Organizations;Mathematical models;Teamwork","","","","13","USGov","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In its philosophy core, 6G embodies the “human in the loop” principle. The research effort aimed at 6G requires an interdisciplinary approach that ignites discussion across different key technological sectors, ranging from communications to services and business cases. The contribution of this book to research in the field concerns an evolutionary and interdisciplinary design of 6G as a paradigm that can be addressed by working together the four different computational areas of CONASENSE: communications; satellites and navigation; sensing; services. This book starts with a perspective on 6G challenges towards sustainability and addressing new business models, moving on to key topics concerning communications. It ends with chapters focusing on 6G service design.

While the College of Engineering at the participating university saw a lot of major switching in the first year, there were not many students switching into computer science (CS). This could have been because other engineering major classes did not transfer well to CS or that students would be a year behind in the programming classes. In either case, the participating university felt that computational thinking and programming were an important part of first-year engineering exploration and believed that all 21st century engineering majors should learn to program in a general purpose language, such as Python or C++. Past research found that prior programming experience, knowledge organization, self-efficacy, and class size were factors impacting student performance in early programming courses, and learning about programming enhanced students' problem-solving skills and improved perceptions about CS. Many other research studies showed that the context in which programming material was presented to non-majors was important for their learning and interest, and themed, mixed-context courses with real-world engineering problems worked well. Therefore, in the spring 2022, we created 12, 100-person sections of a course titled “Engineering Computational and Algorithmic Thinking” for a new first-year engineering experience. Each section was taught by a different instructor representing a variety of disciplines and topics in the College of Engineering. This paper describes the research to practice and engineering student perceptions of the new, required programming class. We hypothesized that engineering students would say that the course should be required for all engineering majors, but we wanted to know why. We believed that student prior programming experience, engineering major, and other demographics would play a role in their responses. We thematically analyzed student justifications to identify emerging themes, and we used a mixed-method approach to correlate themes to different student demographics, engineering major interest, and prior programming experience. The majority of engineering students agreed that the first-year engineering course should be required, and prior programming experience and major played the largest role.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343028","Lemelson Foundation(grant numbers:20-01770); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343028","computer science;first-year engineering;programming","Knowledge engineering;Switches;Organizations;Manufacturing;Problem-solving;Engineering students;Springs","","","","34","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, this paper proposes a model that combines swarm intelligence algorithms with deep learning to predict carbon prices. In this model, we collect news related to carbon trading, construct a dictionary of carbon financial sentiment, and determine the emotional value of the carbon news. Secondly, The Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) algorithm is improved by updating the escape energy and introducing the inertia weight. Then, the LSTM is optimized using the improved Harris Hawks Optimization (IHHO) algorithm. Finally, technical and emotional data on carbon price as multiple source input values are integrated, and the MS-IHHO-LSTM prediction model is established. The results show that the MAPE of IHHO-LSTM is 1.89%, 30.48%, and 10.30% better than that of HHO-LSTM in Hubei, Shanghai, and Shenzhen Carbon Exchanges, respectively. Similarly, MS-IHHO-LSTM showed a lower MAPE than IHHO-LSTM by 27.79%, 29.82%, and 6.33% in the corresponding regions. The results of the experiment indicate that: 1) Using IHHO to optimize LSTM hyperparameters can avoid falling into local optimal and improve prediction accuracy; 2) Incorporating emotional values can further enhance the model’s performance.

With the emergence of smart things (including smart everyday objects embedded with connectivity, computational ability, sensors, and sometimes actuators, urban robots such as delivery and cleaning robots, smart street lighting, smart vehicles, and smart park benches, and so on) not just within the home but in public spaces, there is a need to consider software engineering challenges for software on such things. Human-centred software engineering and work on ethical behaviours in smart things will need to come together, even as we continue to understand what it takes to effectively develop software (and systems) for such emerging devices. In order to demonstrate how software (and systems) for intelligent devices in public places might be developed, findings from a quantitative survey we performed are discussed in this study. The survey was designed such that the questions focused on the socio-ethical behaviours of smart devices when interacting with people in public places. The survey was based on a supermarket scenario where the participants had to answer the different questions in the questionnaire. There were 250 participants who only completed part of the survey; of them, 60 participants finished it in full. The complete replies have been examined and analysed in this paper. To determine how people feel about employing smart technology in public places, a variety of smart devices, including robots, smart cameras, smart speakers, and smart trolleys, are utilised in the survey questions. According to the findings, more than 80 percent of respondents think it important for smart gadgets to be socially-aware and ethical in public places.General Abstract This paper examines the survey results conducted to explore if smart devices such as robots or smart cameras can be deployed in public areas. The respondents reply to survey questions asking them whether they believe it is crucial to keep smart robots, smart carts, or any other smart devices in the supermarket. The survey’s questions are constructed in such a manner that participants are asked to imagine themselves as either a customer shopping for groceries at a store or a manager running the business and dealing with the friendly robot. This survey was created with the intention of thinking carefully about how intelligent software systems may be designed from the standpoint of software engineering for public settings. Later in this article, the survey findings and insights are discussed.","2832-7616","979-8-3503-2261-3","10.1109/ICSE-SEIS58686.2023.00022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10173917","Smart devices;smart things;socio-ethical policy;supermarket;IoT;human-device interaction","Surveys;Space vehicles;Performance evaluation;Ethics;Smart cameras;Robot sensing systems;Software systems","","","","12","IEEE","11 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the one hand, the combination of these two theories makes models more practical by considering the psychological behaviors of decision makers. On the other hand, we can effectively combine the advantages of the three-way decision theory with the regret theory to highlight the interpretability of decision-making processes. In this article, we propose a novel approximate estimation method for incomplete utility values via the regret theory and establish a wide sense of a three-way decision model on incomplete multiscale decision information systems. First, the degree of consistency for each scale is measured via using the dependence degree, then the optimal subsystem is selected by evaluating the scale selection cost. Furthermore, the incomplete multiscale evaluation information is transformed into triangular fuzzy numbers via linguistic term sets. Second, in light of fuzzy evaluation values and tradeoff factors, an estimation method for incomplete fuzzy subsystems is constructed, which can be used to calculate the utility difference and regret-rejoicing values for pairwise comparisons. Finally, from the perspective of human cognition, the tripartition and the corresponding decision rules are built by the tolerance degree, and the ranking of objects is calculated by the relative closeness degree. Additionally, multiaspect comparative and experimental analyses are performed by extensive experiments, and the feasibility, validity, and stability of the constructed model are shown by parametric analyses.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2023.3237646","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:12161036,61866011); Spanish National research project(grant numbers:PGC2018-099402-B-I00); Spanish Ministry of Economy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018542","Complete multiscale decision information system;multiattribute decision making (MADM);regret theory;three-way decision (TWD);triangular fuzzy number","Decision making;Information systems;Psychology;Decision theory;Indexes;Biological system modeling;Mathematical models","","45","","48","IEEE","17 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, some experiments show the law of total probability can be violated. In recent years, researchers have tried to explain this paradox with the interference effect in quantum theory, and they think the main reason for interference effects is the uncertain information in the decision-making process. Therefore, how to effectively model and process the uncertain information in the decision-making process is very important to understand and predict the interference effects. Zadeh proposed the fuzzy set by considering the fuzziness of information. Later, Atanassov proposed the intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS). IFS better describes the fuzzy information from the view of membership, nonmembership than fuzzy sets, which can also more flexibly simulate human decision making. Hence, the article proposed the fuzzy Markov decision-making model (FDM) under the framework of IFS to explain and predict the interference effects of decision-making process. In FDM, intuitionistic fuzzy number can be generated by using the negation operation of probability. In addition, the transition matrix can be obtained by using the Kolmogorov equation, which can consider the evolution time in the decision-making process. The transition matrix establishes the relationship between different stages to get the fuzzy numbers of final states. Finally, the article used the Dempster–Shafer evidence theory to transform fuzzy number into the probability. In summary, the proposed FDM can provide a novel idea to explore and explain the interference effects in the decision-making process, which is helpful to promote the development of artificial intelligence.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2022.3184784","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973332); JSPS Invitational Fellowships for Research in Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9802711","Dempster–Shafer evidence theory;interference effects;intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFS);Markov decision-making model;negation","Decision making;Interference;Markov processes;Fuzzy sets;Evidence theory;Quantum mechanics;Predictive models","","5","","59","IEEE","21 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Among several methods to achieve this, fuzzy logic controllers (FLCs) have been a popular choice over the years, incorporating human-like thinking into their design to promote flexibility, robustness, and reliability. In addition, due to its high performance, low power consumption, and high circuit density, a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) may be a suitable choice for implementing these controllers. This study aims to identify the applicability of FPGA-based FLCs for the MPPT of PV panels. A systematic literature review was conducted, focusing on five research questions. The methods proposed in the 14 selected studies were analyzed in terms of their advantages and limitations. Results demonstrate that FLCs are remarkably adequate for MPPT, although they are preferred when used in conjunction with other techniques. By employing FPGAs, fuzzy controllers may achieve significantly faster responses at an overall lower cost. However, this comes with increased complexity and resource usage. The findings highlight the suitability while acknowledging the limitations of FLCs and FPGAs for the MPPT in PV panels. Moreover, some aspects still require further research, such as methods for dealing with partial shading conditions, the analysis of modern techniques not yet explored in FPGAs, and the integration of FPGA-based technologies in large-scale grids.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2024.3392846","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10508043","Field-programmable gate array (FPGA);fuzzy logic controller (FLC);maximum power point tracking (MPPT);solar panel;systematic review","Field programmable gate arrays;Fuzzy logic;Reviews;Systematics;Maximum power point trackers;Costs;Fuzzy systems","","","","21","IEEE","24 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Technology development has increased the importance of information technology-related competencies for the new generation. Programming skills are essential in various industries nowadays. Thus, programming education has become necessary to cultivate students' relevant abilities to meet the rapid pace of development. Programming learning encourages students to think logically and systematically, solve problems effectively, and develop computational thinking skills. However, learning programming is challenging for many students for different reasons, such as its inherent complexity, inadequate study methods, and pedagogical approaches unsuited to promote programming learning. Traditional teaching methods are often impersonalized and only suitable for some learning styles present in class. Moreover, the challenges encountered by the students as novice programmers are attributed to their low learning motivation. To learn to program, students must comprehend different syntactic conventions, complex instructions, and logical operators and actively engage in practical learning activities, often facing difficulties. This may reduce their learning motivation leading to failure and dropout. To accommodate different learning styles and increase students' motivation, this study employed the ARCS motivation model to design various innovative activities in a flipped classroom setting to increase students' motivation and improve teachers' teaching effectiveness. The study utilized a pretest-posttest method with two groups of grade five students to compare the effectiveness of teaching and learning between the flipped and traditional classroom students. The study's findings revealed that the flipped classroom experimental group showed significantly higher learning motivation than the students in the control group. Moreover, it was found that different flipped classroom activities, including the use of gamification, flipped videos, self-study, self-questioning, self-assessment, split programming tasks, group cooperation, and demonstration activities, had a positive influence on various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model, such as attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10342942","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342942","Flipped classroom;Computer science;Motivation;ARCS Model;Block-based programming education","Industries;Electronic learning;Education;Syntactics;Complexity theory;Online services;Task analysis","","1","","38","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider the application of automotive MIMO radar, which traditionally synthesizes a large uniform virtual array by appropriate waveform and physical array design. We explore deliberately introducing holes into this virtual array to leverage resolution gains provided by the increased aperture. The presence of these holes requires re-thinking DOA estimation, as conventional algorithms may no longer be easily applicable and alternative techniques, such as array interpolation, may be computationally expensive. Consequently, we study sparse array geometries that permit the direct application of spatial smoothing. We show that a sparse array geometry is amenable to spatial smoothing if it can be decomposed into the sum set of two subsets of suitable cardinality. Furthermore, we demonstrate that many such decompositions may exist-not all of them yielding equal identifiability or aperture. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to guarantee identifiability of a given number of targets, which gives insight into choosing desirable decompositions for spatial smoothing. This provides uniform recovery guarantees and enables estimating DOAs at increased resolution and reduced computational complexity. 1","2576-2303","979-8-3503-2574-4","10.1109/IEEECONF59524.2023.10476921","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10476921","","Geometry;Sufficient conditions;Smoothing methods;Direction-of-arrival estimation;Estimation;Apertures;Radar applications","","1","","17","IEEE","1 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this task is challenging due to the diversity of the available pipelines that are difficult to evaluate. Here, we present an overview of a computational framework that combines electrophysiological data with dynamic functional connectivity approach (dFC) followed by dimensionality reduction methods. We highlighted the utility of such framework in tracking the dynamics of key brain network states. Then, we provide a practical example on real MEG data during fast motor task.

The first approach (programming) is directly related to the software implementation and the second approach addresses the hardware instrumentation part. Both approaches are developed in a practical teaching case, from a STEM Maker workshop which consisted of 15 sessions with duration 2 hours each one. Each session consisted of 4 stages: Stage 1 (Theoretical concepts), Stage 2 (Practical Example), Stage 3 (Practice) and Stage 4 (challenge). Through these four stages, the development of skills of the attendees in the areas of programming and electronics was encouraged, applying the STEM Maker strategy. From some evaluation instruments, data was collected about the development of skills of the assistants in the implementation of software and hardware instrumentation, acquired in the STEM Maker workshop. The results indicated that approximately 70% of the workshop attendees developed the necessary skills to propose solutions to problems in their current context where the application of programming and/or electronics intervenes. The product obtained from the practice is described as a temperature control which integrates a feedback signal, this system has a wide field of applications which allowed the students of the STEM Maker workshop to achieve a project related to the individual context of each one.","","979-8-3503-4344-1","10.1109/JICV59748.2023.10565656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10565656","STEM Methodology;closed-loop;control;Maker movement;learning approach","Conferences;Instruments;Education;Collaboration;Programming;Software;Hardware","","","","50","IEEE","25 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article proposes a program that combines cross genetic thinking with artificial bee colony algorithm (hereinafter referred to as Ag) to select the features of hyperspectral images, In the preprocessing stage, the initial feature set of the image is screened by using the outlier detection method based on the percentage level, and the feature set after the initial screening is selected by Ag algorithm. Finally, the selected band combination is sent to the neural network combining three-dimensional convolution and two-dimensional convolution for training, Experimental results on the Pavia University and Indian Pines datasets show that the algorithm has good convergence, and the band combination obtained with low computational complexity can achieve better classification accuracy and consistency in image classification.","","979-8-3503-2538-6","10.1109/ISCTIS58954.2023.10213204","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10213204","Artificial bee colonies;feature selection;application status;hyperspectral remote sensing images;outlier detection methods;convolutional neural networks","Convolution;Redundancy;Neural networks;Feature extraction;Genetics;Artificial bee colony algorithm;Classification algorithms","","","","21","IEEE","16 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various Computer Science assessment tests such as the SCS1, MG-CSCI, PSIv1 and the Fairy Assessment have been developed for different age groups. These tests mostly include computational thinking, programming or topics that could be categorized in the first two core topic areas data and coding and algorithms. Hence, the research desideratum was to develop a test specifically for measuring the four core topic areas. These core topic areas are part of the educational plan of the new interdisciplinary subject IMP (Informatics, Mathematics, Physics) for secondary schools in Germany. The test was piloted with 156 (m = 117, f = 37, o = 2) 10th grade students, approximately aged 16 at the end of the lower secondary level. We used the Item-Response-Theory (IRT) to validate the test. This work in progress paper presents translated items and the psychometric evaluation of the piloted test.

IoT is a topic to interest new learners in programming. Given the fact that there are already plenty of tools e.g. Micro:bit and Arduino designed to make IoT programming simple and full of fun, it is usually believed that adopting IoT topics is beneficial for younger students learning how to program. However, younger students’ learning performance in programming courses varies dramatically depending on the tools mentioned above. There are many metrics to predict the academic achievements of young students. Among them, the operation span is an objective one. Operation span mainly assesses one’s working memory capacity. According to the research results, one’s working memory capacity predicts individual high-level cognitive performance. Furthermore, students’ cognitive performance was highly related to their learning performance in programming courses. Nevertheless, the relationship between operation span and the learning performance of programming courses for junior high school students has not been researched yet. In Taiwan, computer programming has already been included as a mandatory subject in the junior high school curriculum for developing students' computational thinking and problem-solving skills. As such, understanding the relationship between OSPAN and programming performance is crucial for effective teaching and learning in this subject. We designed an experiment for an IoT-related after-school club in a junior high school to evaluate the relationship between students’ operation span and learning performance.","","979-8-3503-3386-2","10.1109/ICEIB57887.2023.10170028","National Science and Technology Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10170028","operation_span;cognitive_ability;learning","Measurement;Education;Programming;Big Data;Market research;Internet of Things;Problem-solving","","","","8","IEEE","7 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our motivation is that there are no robust and scalable automatic methods for the analysis of computational thinking from source code programmed by elementary-level students. The approach to this problem supports the improvement of PC development in primary and secondary school students. The validation of the method is performed through the assessment of the answers of primary school students to programming exercises using a programming language called LIE++. The method assesses student answers using several techniques such as the analysis of programming structures, code clones and the execution of code based on input and output values defined during the specification of the exercises.

However, in the small reality of the classroom, some discrepancies arise between policy objectives and everyday practice. The research community emphasises the importance of providing technology infusions based on educators' pedagogical beliefs as well as needs rooted in the authentic scholarly environment. Considering this perspective when orchestrating in-classroom technology can support educators in their daily experiences and enhance their digital competencies. To contribute to this aim, we propose a case study carried out via interviews with fellow primary and secondary teachers, tackling challenges in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics), including Computer Science (CS) and Computational thinking (CT) education delivery. Along with the teachers' perspectives, our study aims to obtain a detailed account of the classroom's internal dynamics as perceived by the teachers. The most prominent findings concern the disparity among educators' proficiency in technology endorsement, impacting the consistency in content delivery, the complexity of the assessment of students' learning process if it is digital-based, and the inclusivity and trustworthiness of online content. Finally, we suggest guidance for a further mindful in-school uptake of technology to support teachers in orchestrating content delivery with educational technologies and enhance their confidence in this aspect.","2165-9567","979-8-3503-9402-3","10.1109/EDUCON60312.2024.10578908","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10578908","Digital Literacy;STEM;Digital Education;Learning;Educational Technology;Teachers","Computer science;Technological innovation;Catalysts;Educational technology;Complexity theory;Stakeholders;Interviews","","","","45","IEEE","8 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning have opened up new possibilities, providing unprecedented computational power and problem-solving capabilities while offering a deeper understanding of complex systems. Our research proposes new variational methods based on a deep learning system based on an optical quantum neural network applied to Machine Learning models for point classification. As a case study, we considered the binary classification of points belonging to a certain geometric pattern (the Two-Moons Classification problem) on a plane. We think it is reasonable to expect benefits from using hybrid deep learning systems (classical + quantum), not just in terms of accelerating computation but also in understanding the underlying phenomena and mechanisms. This will result in the development of new machine-learning paradigms and a significant advancement in the field of quantum computation. The selected dataset is a set of 2D points creating two interleaved semicircles and is based on a 2D binary classification generator, which aids in evaluating the performance of particular methods. The two coordinates of each unique point,  $x_{1}$  and  $x_{2}$ , serve as the features since they present two disparate data sets in a two-dimensional representation space. The goal was to create a quantum deep neural network that could recognise and categorise points accurately with the fewest trainable parameters possible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3335625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10325513","Quantum computing;variational methods;deep learning;quantum feed-forward neural networks;optical quantum computing","Quantum computing;Quantum mechanics;Logic gates;Computers;Nonlinear optics;Optical network units;Deep learning;Feedforward neural networks;Neural networks","","","","67","CCBY","21 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A timely detection of these issues is challenging but crucial, since it could open the possibility to offer help to people before the illness gets worse. One alternative to accomplish this is to monitor how people express themselves, that is for example what and how they write, or even a step further, what emotions they express in their social media communications. In this article, we analyze two computational representations that aim to model the presence and changes of the emotions expressed by social media users. In our evaluation we use two recent public data sets for two important mental disorders: Depression and Anorexia. The obtained results suggest that the presence and variability of emotions, captured by the proposed representations, allow to highlight important information about social media users suffering from depression or anorexia. Furthermore, the fusion of both representations can boost the performance, equalling the best reported approach for depression and barely behind the top performer for anorexia by only 1 percent. Moreover, these representations open the possibility to add some interpretability to the results.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2021.3075638","Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnologa(grant numbers:Scholarship 654803); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9416889","Mental disorders;emotional patterns;machine learning","Depression;Social networking (online);Mental disorders;Mental health;Task analysis;Linguistics;Blogs","","20","","51","IEEE","27 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our 21st century K-12 students are no longer just computer users, but are now required to be computationally literate creators with proficient skills both in the concepts and practices of CS and CT. At the same time, technology continues to pervade our lives and expand at a relentless pace and all aspects of our lives are now embedded in technology surrounded by Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI in the form of Machine Learning (ML) is a key technology in a diversity of applications, where we use sensors to meaningfully perceive the world around us, analyze and organize the perceived data, and autonomously use that data to make predictions and decisions. In higher education, AI/ML courses proliferate, with many institutions now conferring degrees and certifications in these. To an extent, some high schools (grades 9–12) have started introducing these concepts in a technology class, or a robotics club, or as an after-school activity. As for middle (grades 6–8) and elementary school (grades K-5), there are very few examples of such instruction. In this paper, we present a complete framework for elementary and middle school teachers to help them prepare and incorporate AI/ML lessons in their classrooms using hands-on active learning strategies. We want to empower these teachers to impart improved learning to their students, which in turn will prepare their students to become effective thinkers, problem solvers, communicators, and gain necessary skills for high-skilled and high-demand jobs.

In particular, multiple approaches to teaching visual programming have been explored, from the use of tools such as Scratch, robots, unplugged programming, or activities for the development of computational thinking. Despite the wide range of resources used, students generally tend to perform poorly academically and perceive learning visual programming as a complex and demotivating task. In this article, the TutoApp system is proposed together with a new methodology based on “Learning by Teaching,” where students create tutorials on their mobile devices to explain programming concepts to their peers. The hypothesis of this article is that the use of this tool improves learning outcomes and the level of student satisfaction. An experiment with a pre–posttest design has been carried out with 57 university students in an introductory programming course, 30 belonging to a control group (did not use TutoApp) and 27 belonging to the experimental group (used TutoApp). The findings indicate that the creation of tutorials with TutoApp significantly improved students' academic performance over those who did not use it, specifically in learning the loops and conditional control structures. However, it was observed that anxiety increased in all students while learning visual programming. The results of this study open the door to the validation of the use of systems and methodologies for creating tutorials for teaching visual programming to university students.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2022.3226122","Rey Juan Carlos University, Grant Puente 2021, URJC(grant numbers:M2614); Madrid Regional Government; e-Madrid-CM(grant numbers:S2018/TCS-4307); Structural Funds; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9969519","Emotions;learning by teaching;mobile devices;visual programming;written composition","Education;Visualization;Programming profession;Writing;Tutorials;Anxiety disorders;Task analysis","","2","","87","IEEE","2 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The participants were in-service teachers in the technology domain. This research applied the AI2 Robot City, which is a computational thinking board game, to in-service teacher education. The learning content was image classification for AI application. Elementary and junior high school teachers operated the MIT App Inventor(MAI) and Personal Image Classifier(PIC) platform, and trained the model for practicing AI to implement supervised machine learning on the PIC platform. The learners then inserted the model they had trained into the block-based programming environment of MAI. They completed the smart phone app and used the app to recognize the board game cards so as to control the movement of the smart cars on the table map to meet the requirements of the task in the AI2 Robot City board game. In order to understand affective factors such as the self-efficacy and learning anxiety of the elementary and middle school teachers participating in the AI teacher training workshop, the MLSE and AILA scales were administered before and after the classes. A total of 28 samples were collected. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the MLSE of the elementary and junior high school teachers. However, the average AILA degree of the junior high school teachers was significantly higher than that of the elementary school teachers. It was found that AILA was significantly negatively correlated with MLSE. The elementary and junior high school teachers were confident that they could study AI-related courses. However, the AILA of the junior high school teachers was higher than that of the elementary school teachers. Therefore, more teacher training workshops on AI application can be conducted for junior high school teachers to generally improve their familiarity with AI application. Future research can further explore whether teachers will gradually improve their AILA and MLSE with time and as training courses increase.","","978-1-6654-7290-6","10.1109/ICAIE56796.2023.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10143930","in-service teacher education;artificial intelligence education;learning self-efficacy of machine learning;artificial intelligence learning anxiety","Training;Maximum likelihood estimation;Conferences;Anxiety disorders;Urban areas;Learning (artificial intelligence);Games","","1","","13","IEEE","7 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design of the VR ambiance should align with the learning objectives and provide relevant challenges and tasks that require students to use their computer technology skills to solve problems. A well-designed VR ambiance can encourage exploration and creativity in computer technology students. By providing a virtual space that allows experimentation and innovation, students can explore different approaches, test ideas, and think creatively when solving problems. This paper studies how students and professors evaluated the development of competencies during an extracurricular project for the development of a virtual interactive environment for learning a process. Designing an interactive virtual environment will require the implementation of various interactive elements, such as 3D objects, user interfaces, and animations. Students can apply their programming skills to create the necessary functionality in the virtual environment. To create an attractive and easy-to-use virtual environment, students will need to consider UX design principles. In this case, the competencies to be measured were: Solving problems generating efficient computational algorithms under models and tools of computer science and developing software applying process and quality standards of Software Engineering. To assess compliance with the development of competencies, it was decided to develop an interactive virtual environment; this is a process that involves several stages, from conceptualization to implementation and testing. The objectives of the virtual environment were established. In this case, it was decided to develop an environment that would help the user learn how to change a flat tire. A plan was created detailing how users will interact with the virtual environment. Early results show that more than 50% of the students outstandingly developed problem-solving competence, additionally, if we add the students who obtained a solid evaluation, the percentage of students who developed the competence in a more than acceptable way would go up to 93%.

However, consideration for the user's needs and experiences is as important as the educational content itself, in order to ensure that the learner has an engaging experience. For this reason, this paper explores the integration of Empathic Design principles into the user experience (UX) evaluation of several popular programming genre games aimed at cultivating CT. The findings indicate a partial positive alignment with these principles, particularly in user-centric design, learning journey, and visual aspects.

Through this paper we propose a game based learning model which can be used as problems in a problem based learning framework. In contrast to learning activities supplied using more old-fashioned didactic methodologies, this strategy can be used to engage a student through meaningful activities. This paper presents a model to use game in problem based learning followed by a case study and its analysis. Giglane game was used in the process to analyze the effectiveness with respect to number of stakeholders and incidents reported. The method is validated for effectiveness and promises to be an effective strategy for reflections and self-directed learning attributes.

Pre-studies analyzing students' perspectives regarding the inclusion of digital competences in the teacher education program of a large Central-European university revealed that less than half of the students who were at an advanced stage in their studies felt sufficiently prepared to impart digital competences in their daily teaching. Given the importance of being digitally competent in the modern, digital era, the question arises, how digital competences can be sustainably included in the curriculum of a teacher education program. This paper analyzes interviews with five faculty members successfully teaching digital skills in concert with subject didactics of Geography in order to identify best practices for the integration of digital competences. The first author asked our Interview Partners to provide insight into the content they mediated, the integration of digital competences and tools in their courses, how their teaching could be further improved, and what challenges they encounter. Eventually, we looked for best practices and collected instructors' thoughts on improvements on a curricular level and examples of transferring the good practices to other subjects, such that future students could benefit from a better integration of digital competences. For this paper, we analyzed the data with a mixture of narrative analysis and thematic analysis. Improving the mediating of digital skills and competences in a wider range of subjects at the university level should eventually help students, and ultimately their students, to implement digital know-how such as modern teaching tools into their courses, making teaching more effective and computational thinking as well as related fields of computing more accessible to academic as well as secondary and younger students. The research so far has shown promising results considering examples of tools that can be used on a broad spectrum of subjects and lead to a factor of learned new digital competences if used properly. On the other hand, lecturers also warned about relying too much on technology in specific tasks such as orientation on a map or analyzing statistical data. We conclude that combining existing approaches with new, more modern didactics can be the key to transferring the competencies required for our students' future.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-3642-9","10.1109/FIE58773.2023.10343210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343210","digital skills;teacher education;pre-service teachers;basic digital education;interviews","Geography;Digital transformation;Education;Open Educational Resources;Behavioral sciences;Interviews;Task analysis","","","","28","IEEE","5 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Uncertainty and high-dimensional data provide issues that are addressed by the combination of WT and IT2FLS. With the use of fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering for unsupervised structure learning and evolutionary algorithms for supervised parameter adjustment, the IT2FLS employs a hybrid learning approach. The use of WT streamlines this computationally demanding learning process, lowering computational load and improving IT2FLS performance. Well-known medical datasets (Cleveland heart disease and Wisconsin breast cancer) from the UCI Collection for machine learning are used for experimental assessments. Computed performance measures include area under the receiver operator characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy.

"Exploring Students’ Perceptions of ChatGPT: Thematic Analysis and Follow-Up Survey","A.

To analyze its impact on teaching and learning it is crucial to understand how students perceive ChatGPT and assess its potential and challenges. Toward this, we conducted a two-stage study with senior students in a computer engineering program ( $n=56$ ). In the first stage, we asked the students to evaluate ChatGPT using their own words after they used it to complete one learning activity. The returned responses (3136 words) were analyzed by coding and theme building (36 codes and 15 themes). In the second stage, we used the derived codes and themes to create a 27-item questionnaire. The students responded to this questionnaire three weeks later after completing other activities with the help of ChatGPT. The results show that the students admire the capabilities of ChatGPT and find it interesting, motivating, and helpful for study and work. They find it easy to use and appreciate its human-like interface that provides well-structured responses and good explanations. However, many students feel that ChatGPT’s answers are not always accurate and most of them believe that it requires good background knowledge to work with since it does not replace human intelligence. So, most students think that ChatGPT needs to be improved but are optimistic that this will happen soon. When it comes to the negative impact of ChatGPT on learning, academic integrity, jobs, and life, the students are divided. We conclude that ChatGPT can and should be used for learning. However, students should be aware of its limitations. Educators should try using ChatGPT and guide students on effective prompting techniques and how to assess generated responses. The developers should improve their models to enhance the accuracy of given answers. The study provides insights into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT in education and informs future research and development.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3268224","Mohammed Bin Rashid Smart Learning Program, Ministry of Education, United Arab Emirates; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105236","ChatGPT;students’ perceptions;education","Chatbots;Education;Codes;Encoding;Performance evaluation;Oral communication","","91","","38","CCBYNCND","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Most PIM approaches use the CPU’s memory requests to deliver instructions and operands to the PIM engines, making a core busy and incurring unnecessary data transfer, thus, resulting in significant offloading overhead. DMA can resolve the issue by transferring a high volume of successive data without intervening CPU and polluting the memory hierarchy, thus perfectly fitting the PIM concept. However, the small computing resources of DRAM-based PIM devices allow us to transfer only small amounts of data at one DMA transaction and require a large number of descriptors, thus still incurring significant offloading overhead. This paper introduces PIM Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) using a DMA descriptor called PISA-DMA to express a PIM opcode and operand in a single descriptor. Our ISA makes PIM programming intuitive by thinking of committing one PIM instruction as completing one DMA transaction and representing a sequence of PIM instructions using the DMA descriptor list. Also, PISA-DMA minimizes the offloading overhead while guaranteeing compatibility with commercial platforms. Our PISA-DMA eliminates the opcode offloading overhead and achieves 1.25x, 1.31x, and 1.29x speedup over the baseline PIM at the sequence length of 128 with the BERT, RoBERTa, and GPT-2 models, respectively, in ONNX runtime with real machines. Also, we study how our proposed PISA affects performance in compiler optimization and show that the operator fusion of matrix-matrix multiplication and element-wise addition achieved 1.04x speedup, a similar performance gain using conventional ISAs.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3238812","SK Hynix Inc.; Institute for Information & Communications Technology Promotion (IITP) Grant; Korea Government (MSIP) (Memory-Centric Architecture Using the Reconfigurable PIM Devices)(grant numbers:2022-0-00441); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024282","Processing-in-DRAM;direct memory access;instruction set architecture;PIM offloading","Engines;Computer architecture;Registers;Switches;DRAM chips;Random access memory;Programming","","3","","40","CCBY","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Users think that it is easier to follow the agenda by accessing news, especially on Twitter, rather than newspaper news pages. However, fake news is increasingly appearing on social media, and it is not always possible for people to obtain correct news from partial news pages or short Twitter posts. Understanding whether the news shared on Twitter is true or not is an important problem. Detecting fake tweets is of great importance in Turkish as well as in any language. In this study, fake news obtained from verification platforms on Twitter and real news obtained from the Twitter accounts of mainstream newspapers were labeled and, preprocessed using the Zemberek natural language processing tool developed for the Turkish language, and a dataset named TR_FaRe_News was created. Then, the TR_FaRe_News dataset was explored using ensemble methods and BoW, TF-IDF, and Word2Vec vectorization methods for fake news detection. Then a pre-trained BERT deep learning model was fine-tuned, and variations of the model extended with Bi-LSTM and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) layers with the frozen and unfrozen parameters methods were explored. The performance evaluation was conducted using seven comparable datasets, namely BuzzFeedNews, GossipCop, ISOT, LIAR, Twitter15, and Twitter16, including an LLM-generated fake news dataset. Analyzing Turkish tweets and using fake news datasets generated by LLM is considered an important contribution.

An innovative land suitability assessment model, merging ResNet-50 with the k-means algorithm, is devised. Specifically, ResNet-50 is harnessed for the classification and recognition of rural land-use images, thus deriving feature vectors for each sample. These feature vectors are subsequently fed into the k-means algorithm to cluster samples with akin land-use patterns. The ensuing examination of land use composition within each cluster facilitates the evaluation of rural land’s suitability for three-industry integration. Experimental scrutiny discloses that this study achieves an accuracy rate of 88.3% in rural land-use classification and recognition, outperforming alternative algorithms by at least 3.1%. Furthermore, it yields an average intersection over union (IoU) of 67.29%. Remarkably, the k-means algorithm exhibits superior clustering outcomes. Consequently, the model introduces herein demonstrated substantial enhancements in rural land-use classification and recognition accuracy, average IoU, and clustering performance.

In recent years, convolutional neural network (CNN) has dominated the primary workhorse for depth estimation. However, the interpretability of the network and the accuracy of the depth estimation results still need to be improved. This paper uses the conditional random field (CRF) theory to explain and model the LF depth estimation. Further, from the perspective of sequence analysis, we extract the sequence features of epipolar plane image (EPI) patches with recurrent neural network (RNN) and serve as the unary term of the energy function in the CRF. Then, a unified neural network (called as LFRNN) is designed to solve the CRF and get the disparity map. Our LFRNN builds upon two-stage architecture, involving a local depth estimation and a depth refinement. In the first part, we design an RNN to analyze the vector sequences in EPI patches and obtain local disparity values. There are two thinking behind the design of this part. The first is the general principle that the slope of the straight line in the EPI is inversely proportional to the depth; the second is our unique observation that those straight lines are distributed in vector sequences. In the second part, continuous CRF is used to optimize the output of the first part. We train LFRNN on a synthetic LF dataset and test it on both synthetic and real-world LF datasets. Quantitative and qualitative results validate the superior performance of our LFRNN over the state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3296800","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62076122); Natural Science Foundation of the Nanjing Institute of Technology(grant numbers:ZKJ201906); Open Foundation from the Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center of IntelliSense Technology and System(grant numbers:ITS202101,ITS202201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10188391","Computer vision;depth estimation;light field imaging;deep learning;sequence analysis","Estimation;Light fields;Conditional random fields;Cameras;Lenses;Deep learning;Sequences;Computer vision;Sequential analysis;Image processing","","1","","36","CCBYNCND","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To that end, we focus mainly on the functional aspects of head movement and facial expressions as insightful cues. For example, head movement functions include the speaker’s rhythm and the listener’s back channel and thinking processes, as well as their positive emotions. Facial expression functions include emotional expressions and communicative functions such as the speaker addressing the listener and the listener’s affirmation. In addition, our model employs synergetic functions, which are jointly performed with head movements and facial expressions, assuming that the simultaneous appearance of head and face functions could strengthen the results or lead to multiplexing. On the basis of these nonverbal functions, we define a set of functional features, including the rate of occurrence and composition balance among different functions that emerge during conversation. Then, a feature selection scheme is used to identify the best combinations of intermodal and intramodal features. In the experiments, an SA-Off corpus of 17 groups of discussions involving 4 female participants was used, including interlocutors’ self-reported scores for 16 impression items felt during the discussion, such as helpfulness and interest. The experiments confirmed that our models’ predictions were significantly correlated with the self-reported scores for more than 70% of the impression items. These results indicate the effectiveness of multimodal nonverbal functional features for predicting subjective impressions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3426537","Public Foundation of Chubu Science and Technology Center; Telecom Advanced Technology Research Support Center; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP21K12011,24K02998); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10595088","Facial expression;feature selection;group meeting;head movement;multimodal recognition;nonverbal communication;social signal;subjective impression","Indium tin oxide;Face recognition;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Eyebrows;Facial animation;Facial animation","","","","61","CCBYNCND","11 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To combat this issue, various solutions have been proposed, utilizing Machine learning and Deep learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural Networks. These methods rely on a mathematical approach to distinguish one class from another. However, when dealing with sentiment-oriented data, a more “critical thinking” perspective is needed for accurate classification, as it provides a more realistic representation of how people interpret online messages. Based on a literature review conducted to explore efficient classification techniques, this study applied two machine learning classifiers, Multinomial Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, to four online hate datasets.

We explore how different DL methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are used to diagnose types of dementia such as Alzheimer’s, vascular dementia, and Lewy body dementia. We also discuss the difficulties of using DL for diagnosing dementia, like the lack of large and varied datasets and the challenge of applying models to different groups of people. These issues indicate the need for more dependable and understandable models that consider a wide range of patient characteristics and biomarkers. Longitudinal studies are also needed to understand how the disease progresses and how treatments work. Collaboration among researchers, doctors, and data scientists is crucial to ensure DL models are scientifically sound and effective in clinical settings. In summary, DL techniques show promise for automated dementia diagnosis and could improve how accurately and efficiently it is diagnosed in practice.

You can see various attempts at a news media platform based on Blockchain technology. However, the Blockchain news media platform is still not getting the market response we expected. It is questionable whether the reason is simply because it is a new technology, so it takes a long time to gain trust from consumers, whether consumers are not yet expecting an innovative news media platform, or whether the explosive growth of the Blockchain news media platform is difficult for other reasons. Research to answer this or direct research between Blockchain and media platforms is still lacking. In addition, the method of verifying fake news using artificial intelligence was verified, ANN, CBR, and MDA were changed, and the experiment was verified for progress. In addition, the use of 5-fold cross-validation as a comparative method was added as described above to more closely examine the possibility of its usefulness even in general situations. Also, through various fields of artificial intelligence and blockchain, verification work was done with blockchain, and fake news prediction was made using artificial intelligence.

However, existing methodologies often fall short of comprehensively considering a pivotal factor influencing these interactions: the core subgraph within molecules, commonly represented by functional groups or atoms capable of engaging in interactions with other molecules. In this work, we propose a novel interaction prediction framework, called GIB-DS, which centers on the identification of the core subgraph in pairs of molecules to anticipate their interaction behavior. Guided by the principles of the Graph Information Bottleneck, our approach adeptly identifies two subgraphs within this pair of graphs that capture the essential information pertinent to the task at hand. We think that the dual-subgraph formulation could more faithfully capture the underlying nature of chemical reactions, where interactions between molecules and the interactions among specific atoms are inherently intertwined. Extensive experimentation across diverse datasets underscores the superiority of GIB-DS over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an approximate 5% improvement.

Billions of people worldwide use them daily to share what they think and feel in their posts. Amongst all social media available platforms, Facebook only contains around three billion personal accounts. In this work Reddit dataset is used to automatically detect mental illness from social media posts. This study is not only limited to early detection of already existing mental illness or disorder like depression and anxiety from social posts, but also and most importantly the study is extended to predict successfully potential mental illness that would happen in future. This study deploys Nineteen different models to study the capability of them in detecting and predicting mental disorders from social media posts. Some of the deployed models are classical machine learning classifiers, some are ensemble learning models, and the rest are large language models (LLMs). Six machine learning classifiers were used in this work for the automatic detection and prediction of mental illness and logistic regression proved to be the best amongst other classifiers in this task. Nine Ensemble methods were also used and examined. Amongst the Nine ensemble learning models VC2, Light GBM, Bagging estimator, and XGBoost proved to be superior in this task. Four large language models were also used and examined for the same task. RoBERTa and OpenAI GPT proved to outperform the rest of models in this task. All those models were built, trained, tested, and compared with previous work in literature to get the best possible results. The study covers the main four mental disorders which are ADHD, Anxiety, Bipolar, and Depression. The work proposed in this paper succeeded in outperforming the results in literature in terms of number of addressed mental disorders, number of models used and tested, and dataset size used to validate results. The proposed work also outperformed the only attempt in literature that addressed all mental disorders in results of detection and prediction noticeably. This work achieved the detection of already existing mental disorders F1-score of 0.80 from clinical data and of 0.52 from non-clinical data, and it achieved a prediction of future mental disorder F1-score of 0.43 from non-clinical data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3406469","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10540133","ADHD;anxiety;bipolar;mental illness classification;depression detection;depression prediction;Reddit","Social networking (online);Depression;Anxiety disorders;Support vector machines;Mental health;Ensemble learning;Predictive models","","","","49","CCBYNCND","28 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, for conventional networks, it has become a challenging task to efficiently control and manage the data flows of a huge number of devices. Software-defined networking (SDN) is a new way of thinking about networking. Because it is programmable, flexible, agile, and gives you a big picture of the network, it has tried to solve some IoT problems, like scalability, heterogeneity, and complexity. In large-scale SDN-IoT networks, there is a requirement for routing protocols that are both efficient and secure in order to ensure a superior level of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). To address the above stated challenges, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) known as DQQS model is proposed. The aim is to achieve QoS and QoE while also ensuring the security of the SDN-IoT network. The proposed DQQS model dynamically extracts patterns from the past network history by interacting with the underlying network and generating optimized routing policies. This article employs three network metrics—throughput, latency, and the probability of avoiding malicious nodes—to measure the performance of DQQS. Simulations reveal that the proposed framework outperforms four state-of-the-art routing algorithms: OSPF, L-L Routing, Sailfish Routing, and RL-Routing in terms of both throughput and latency. For instance, in an attacked environment, the proposed DQQS model achieved the highest throughput value of 14.5 Mbps, surpassing OSPF at 8 Mbps, L-L at 8.2 Mbps, Sailfish at 9 Mbps, and RL at 9.5 Mbps. Similarly, this model exhibited superior performance in latency, recording the lowest latency value of 52 ms, compared to OSPF 88 ms, L-L 85 ms, Sailfish 72 ms, and RL 75 ms routing algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that this new DQQS model is a pioneering deep reinforcement learning-based technique that optimally addresses secure routing in the SDN-IoT environment, ensuring enhanced quality of service and experience, and outperforming state-of-the art DL methodologies in both security and network performance metrics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3392279","Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University Researchers Supporting Project number(grant numbers:PNURSP2024R300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506479","Deep reinforcement learning;Internet of Things;malicious node detection;optimal network management;routing optimization;software defined network;security","Routing;Quality of service;Internet of Things;Quality of experience;Security;Sensors;Optimization;Deep reinforcement learning;Malware;Telecommunication network management;Software defined networking","","","","35","CCBYNCND","22 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
