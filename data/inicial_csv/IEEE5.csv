Therefore, in this research, we try to use conceptual mapping so that students can construct knowledge when composing their own images, as the focus of this learning model and computational thinking is the thinking process and the two coincide. This research intends to introduce the traditional programming robot course into conceptual mapping and measure whether there are differences in computational thinking tendencies, problem-solving tendencies, and intrinsic motivations between students who use conceptual mapping and those who do not use it. The students in the experimental group with conceptual mapping activities developed computational thinking skills during the program robotics course.

To foster CT among K-12 students, different initiatives have been introduced by governmental and non-governmental entities, and numerous studies have been carried out by researchers to define and integrate CT into school curriculum. However, previous studies has shown little agreement among researchers, governmental and non-governmental sectors about a unified CT definition. These dissensions have introduced challenges in formulating a definition for CT at the K-12 level. The absence of a unified definition may increase the challenges for teachers to teach and integrate CT into school curriculum. To foster CT among K-12 students, we introduce a definition and framework for CT. We evaluated 39 articles and extracted the most common elements used in the literature to frame CT definition and describe its elements. Several studies have discussed, as well as investigated, the significance of conceptualizing and comprehending the interaction and dependency relationships among computational objects. However, our literature review discovered that little attention has been dedicated to the concept of dependency in the CT body of knowledge. Based on the literature review, we define CT as the thought process used for solving problems, and it encompasses the elements of problem decomposition, abstraction, and algorithmic thinking. We conjecture the CT definition is missing the element of dependency. In the context of CT, we define dependency as the knowledge of comprehending the interrelationships between different sections of a decomposed problem.","2165-9567","978-1-6654-4434-7","10.1109/EDUCON52537.2022.9766703","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9766703","Computational Thinking (CT);K-12 Education;Dependency;Abstraction;Decomposition;Algorithmic Thinking","Computer science;Bibliographies;Conferences;Computational modeling;Engineering education","","","","69","IEEE","11 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in non-CS majors, CT might not be perceived as essential, and students might lack the motivation to engage with such tools in order to acquire solid CT skills. This article presents a field study conducted with 115 students during a full semester on a novel computational notebook environment. It evaluates computational notebooks and CT skills in an introductory course on information technology for first-year undergraduates in business and economics. A multidimensional evaluation approach makes use of pre- and post-test surveys, lectures, and self-directed laboratory sessions tracking analytics.

This type of thinking promotes learning through the application of planning, analysis, abstraction and decomposition of problems into their constituent parts. In addition, PC contributes to the formation of critical thinking, creativity and cooperation between people. In education, the mechanisms used to foster CP are diverse; among them, learning through programming. Databases of source code generated in learning exercises using the CP method are a valuable tool for discovering learning patterns. However, there are no robust and scalable methods for studying the huge source code bases of learning products to recognize the predominant patterns and determine the effectiveness of the method. Consequently, a comprehensive analysis of learners’ skills, knowledge, outcomes and performance levels is necessary to identify points of improvement to meet learning objectives and modify curricula and exercises.

Game-based learning has recently seen an increase in prevalence for teaching computational thinking, making games an important topic of study. However, there is currently no validated tool for assessing Computational Thinking (CT) that performs reliably across disciplines and age groups. In the absence of such a tool, this paper examines several software testing methods for the evaluation of CT pedagogy effectiveness within serious games. Namely, it makes recommendations for the application of standardized questionnaires, think-aloud testing, and automated data logging for evaluating games that promote CT learning.

In the context of the current era of rapid development of information technology, the educational changes caused by the new development of smart education mean that more attention should be paid to the level of thinking and operational skills of students. As a result, the Problem-Based Learning for Computational Thinking Development Model for Primary and Secondary Schools (CTPBL), which is interdisciplinary, contextual, innovative, experiential and humanistic in nature, has emerged. As a new educational model, CTPBL helps integrate the advantages of existing Project-Based Learning and STEAM Education, crack the dilemma of teachers' choice of the inherent educational model, and realize the cultivation of students' information literacy and the improvement of their comprehensive ability.

Research shows that the task design influences the development of computational thinking (CT). The literature provides evidence that the context, the problem space, and the representation of the problem to apply SRA-programming require the programming task to be embedded in a dynamic context in which a programmable robot must use sensory information to anticipate changes in the environment. In order to ascertain whether the problem space and the task design influence the evocation of SRA-thinking, this article uses a research design comparing the differences between two programming conditions (static/dynamic). In these conditions, pupils use Lego EV-3 robots and Mindstorms software to solve programming problems. As a post-measurement, a Lego challenge is applied. In this article, it is shown that the integration of a dynamic task design to solve a programming problem is essential for a deeper understanding of CT skills. Furthermore, when pupils can immediately test the consequences of their program in a dynamic environment and, thus, the learning environment provides an appropriate problem, they gain a deeper understanding of the added value of sensors and will be better able to reason about complex problems. It is found that programming in a dynamic problem environment almost naturally evokes SRA-thinking, as opposed to programming in a static environment.

However, medical students are lack of this strategy in dealing with problems at present. Meanwhile, there is also a problem of ‘insufficient skills and no training’ in computer learning. In this article, we recommend training students’ computational thinking from three aspects. First, students can learn the basic concepts of computational thinking and different thinking modes of computer scientists through computer courses in both theory and practice in order to train their computational thinking. Second, in the process of thinking, students can directly carry out divergent thinking, logical integration, and practice the thinking methods of scientists such as abstraction and simplification through the mind maps produced by IMindMap software. Third, during the practice of modeling and programming, after using mind maps to make the problem abstract and sort out the content of the creation to draw a flowchart, students start modeling and systematic design through Scratch software. At last, under the help of MATLAB, some specific medical cases enable students to apply computational thinking to practice comprehensively.

The kindergarten version, called TechCheck-K, consists of similar unplugged challenges but reduces the number of response choices from four to three and uses exclusively non-verbal material in the responses to accommodate younger, pre-literate children. We administered TechCheck-K to N =89 kindergarten students from four schools, including 45 boys and 44 girls with no coding experience.

The novel method applied in the project, entitled Sprego (Spreadsheet Lego), is a concept-based problem-solving approach adapted from the didactics of other sciences and computer programming. In the experimental group contextualized, real-world programming problems are presented in a spreadsheet environment. A semi-unplugged data-driven analysis is carried out based on each problem, which is followed by the building of a feasible algorithm, expressed by natural language expressions. The coding is completed in the following step by applying a limited number of spreadsheet (Sprego) functions, multilevel, and array formulas. The final steps of the process are discussion and debugging. On the other hand, classical, tool-centered approaches are applied in the control groups. Our research reveals that the traditional surface approach methods for teaching spreadsheeting do not provide long lasting, reliable knowledge which would provide students and end-users with effective problem-solving strategies, while Sprego does. Beyond this finding, the project proves that Sprego supports schema construction and extended abstraction, which is one of the major hiatus points of traditional surface navigation methods. The project also reveals that developing computational thinking skills should not be downgraded, and the misconceptions of self-taught end-users and user-friendly applications should be reconsidered, especially their application in educational environments. Gaining effective computer problem-solving skills and knowledge-transfer abilities is not magic, but a time-consuming process which requires consciously developed and effective methods, and teachers who accept the incremental nature of the sciences.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3126757","construction(grant numbers:EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00002); European Union through the European Social Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9606871","Algorithm-driven spreadsheeting;long lasting knowledge;schema construction;cognitive load;end-user computing;computational thinking","Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving;Informatics;Mathematics;Task analysis","","4","","128","CCBY","8 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This mindset channels number-crunching toward an ambition to discover knowledge through logic, models and simulations. Here we show how computational cognitive science can be used to reconstruct and analyse the structure of computational thinking mindsets (forma mentis in Latin) through complex networks. As a case study, we investigate cognitive networks tied to key concepts of computational thinking provided by (i) 159 high school students enrolled in a science curriculum and (ii) 59 researchers in complex systems and simulations. Researchers' reconstructed knowledge highlighted a positive mindset about scientific modelling, semantically framing data and simulations as ways of discovering nature. Students correctly identified different aspects of logic reasoning but perceived ‘computation’ as a distressing, anxiety-eliciting task, framed with math jargon and lacking links to real-world discovery. Students' mindsets around ‘data’, ‘model’ and ‘simulations’ critically revealed no awareness of numerical modelling as a way for understanding the world. Our findings provide evidence of a crippled computational thinking mindset in students, who acquire mathematical skills that are not channelled toward real-world discovery through coding. This unlinked knowledge ends up being perceived as distressing number-crunching expertise with no relevant outcome. The virtuous mindset of researchers reported here indicates that computational thinking can be restored by training students specifically in coding, modelling and simulations in relation to discovering nature. Our approach opens innovative ways for quantifying computational thinking and enhancing its development through mindset reconstruction.","2051-1329","","10.1093/comnet/cnab020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9684795","computational thinking;cognitive network science;mindset reconstruction;education","","","","","","","18 Jan 2022","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In many of the engineering career programs, the Physics courses are fundamental, and because of the diversity in contexts, they have not been seen as a subject where students can develop the computational thinking process. Present work describes an empirical study based on the learning of the rigid body concept in physics, with the use of spreadsheets as an electronic tool for promoting the learning with the programming of all the dynamical system, describing the evolution, generating, and analyzing graphics, and explaining the physical phenomena with a high comprehension and transfer of knowledge. At the end, students identified where the concept can be applied in their professional context with the use of a simulation. The learning sequence was implemented in three sessions of 1.5 hours each one, two diagnostic tests were applied, one for identifying the previous knowledge and use of electronic spreadsheets, the second one used as a pretest and post-test, it was focused on the main concepts of the rigid body system, like forces, kinematics, and circular movement. The sequence was implemented with N = 77, students. Session 1, started with the introduction of electronic spreadsheets for their use in science and engineering, some examples in Physics and Mathematics were described with their respect feedbacking for students. For session two, the rigid body concept was described with the support of electronic spreadsheets, all the dynamics, equations, plotting of the results and the relationships of all variables were described; for reinforcing the concept learned, students were asked to solve two more similar exercises with the use of the spreadsheets as homework, and finally they were asked to record, in groups of three students, a video with the solution of the problem assigned. In the video, they must present the problem description, equations and dynamics involved in the solutions and explaining all the programming steps needed to perform the solution in an electronic spreadsheet with its graphical representation and interpretation of the variables, and a description of implications in the changing values of the variables in the mathematical model. At the end of the sequence, in session three, a virtual simulation related to their professional context was used for the reinforcement of all the concepts learned. For analyzing the impact in their learning process, the Normalized Conceptual Gain was used in the pre-test and post-test, results showed a g = 0.85, which represents a high learning and normalized conceptual gain. Finally, the results showed that the computational thinking process can be developed by students, as they must program equations, analyze data, understand it, and identify graphically the variables involved, linking the learning of a physical concept with a computational tool that let them understand in a more clear, specific, and ordered thinking.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962398","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962398","Computational thinking;engineering students;electronic spreadsheets for learning;physics courses in engineering;professional skills","Knowledge engineering;Engineering profession;Solids;Mathematical models;Cognition;Software;Engineering students","","1","","27","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Then, the synthesis results were integrated into the development of computational thinking through gamification and programming knowledge to improve the efficacy of computational learning. The process commenced with an analysis of the learners' needs obtained through the questionnaires concerning computational thinking. Data analysis illuminated the learners' levels of computational thinking as well as a fundamental understanding of what the learners need to be taught or what areas of skills each learner. With regards to this, conventional teaching approaches may not serve best to transmit the relevant knowledge which may subsequently induce unfavorable attitudes toward computational thinking. With the data elicited through the need assessment, instructors will have a clear direction as to how the pedagogical process should be designed to directly address the needs in each of the computational thinking components. In general, each component of them is rather complex, so the researcher incorporated gamification theory-based learning defined by its enjoyable game mechanisms and challenging nature which makes the coding lesson fun with block programming enabling learners to proficiently grasp the concept of computational thinking.","","978-1-6654-1680-1","10.1109/SEA-STEM53614.2021.9668107","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668107","computational thinking;need assessment;gamification;computational thinking with coding","Systematics;Navigation;Education;Games;Programming;Encoding;Pattern recognition","","1","","31","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This article aims to stimulate computational thinking in children from the first years of elementary school, ranging from the 1 st to the 5 th grades, which corresponds to the age group from 6 to 10 years old. For developing computational thinking in the students, a didactic sequence was created using several tools, namely: naval battle, Blockly Games and the Scratch block programming language. The sequence of artifacts created with Scratch simulates a robot with color sensors, and, as students progress in learning, new challenges are added with the use of sensors, sounds and animations.

The purpose of this work-in-progress (WIP) is to identify and compare the existing definitions of CT proposed by various members of the education or research community, and ultimately to give educators and researchers suggestions on understanding this concept for particular purposes or situations. We conducted a systematic review of the definitions of CT from the source of academic articles and categorized the definitions based on their approaches, dimensions, and contexts. Forty-one unique and original concepts were extracted from the search. Results indicate that the existing definitions of CT were mostly formulated 1) with a prototype approach, 2) for the generic purpose of use, 3) in the context of K-12 education, 4) based on the subject of Computer Science. These results provide sufficient granularity to allow us to come up with suggestions on how to choose appropriate and pragmatic CT definitions.","2330-331X","978-1-6654-1383-1","10.1109/ISEC52395.2021.9764144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9764144","Computational Thinking;Algorithmic Thinking;Educational Curriculum;Operational Definition;Systematic review","Computer science;Systematics;Conferences;Education;Prototypes;Pragmatics","","2","","33","IEEE","29 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Based upon constructivist problem-solving learning strategies and supported by a three-dimensional framework, a game-based environment with both individual and collaborative playing modes has been developed as a learning and an assessment tool via learning analytics. Moreover, an exploratory case study has been carried out involving 176 primary school students. Results suggest that this environment is suitable as a learning and assessment tool for CT skills in primary school, providing enduring learning, particularly when it engages the collaborative playing mode. It seems to be better adapted to early primary school stage students, who showed greater improvements and who were able to assimilate more computational concepts than expected. Likewise, special needs or low percentile students benefit even more greatly from the learning tool and especially from the collaborative playing mode.

Therefore, in this paper, we integrate design thinking into project-based learning, firstly, we analyze the connotation of design thinking and explain the necessity of integrating design thinking into project-based learning; secondly, we construct a new model and practice process framework of secondary school programming PBL teaching integrating design thinking based on the general process of project-based learning and the basic model of design thinking, and explain the connotation.

Auto-judgment tools come into being, they can rapidly evaluate the project in some way. Unfortunately, the existing tools are too rigid and they ignore the diversity of Scratch projects. To address this issue, we propose a new dynamic weighted evaluation system (DWES). First, we define a new computational thinking (CT) evaluation criteria from eight aspects. Second, based on the proposed criteria, we present an analysis tool that automatically assesses the CT skills of the learners’ projects. Third, considering the characteristics of projects, we dynamically adjust the evaluation results according to types, so that a single standard is no longer applied roughly to all. This process is data-driven, we consider the CT performance and scripts of projects. We prove the rationality of the evaluation criteria from the aspect of program complexity. Through the correlation analysis between DWES CT scores and experts’ ratings, we find that compared with Dr. Scratch, the correlation coefficient has increased.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2020.3044588","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB2100300); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61877005,61772085); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9321708","Scratch;computational thinking;evaluation system;dynamic weighted","Tools;Sprites (computer);Manuals;Games;Computer languages;Complexity theory;Programming profession","","6","","36","IEEE","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, the transfer of innovations and didactic approaches into teaching is one of the biggest challenges. Introducing coding and robotics would be a possible strategy. Educational robotics provide access to real-world scenarios and offer age-appropriate possibilities to explore digital aspects of living and working environments. Combined with narrative methods, such as digital storytelling, problem-solving skills could be developed. Since the implementation of computer science in primary education requires practical and theoretical knowledge, an educational design approach is used that takes this aspect into account and allows close interaction between researchers and practitioners. This paper focuses on investigating a feasible and effective robotics-based learning environment for developing and supporting problem-solving skills at primary school using the learning and teaching method digital storytelling.

Numerous studies in the last decade shed light on disseminating CT practices. However, there is still a gap in understanding CT as a construct, that is, CT as a complex cognitive dimension. Furthermore, few studies analyze how many constructs can be recognized inside CT by empirical data. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is one of the essential skills in CT, even when we do not apply programming activities. In this exploratory paper, we investigate the Bebras Challenge tasks. Our primary aim is to figure out how many and which are the constructs associated with CT skills derived from data, especially related to algorithmic thinking. The results point out three primary constructs supported by data. We claim that these constructs are a mix of CT skills, mainly algorithmic thinking, abstraction, generalization, evaluation, and pattern recognition. In addition, our study provides additional evidence supporting the idea that algorithmic thinking can be explored by different perspectives beyond “a set of order instructions”, even without programming practices. Thus, this result reinforces the notion that CT can be understood as a mix of several skills to solve problems. Moreover, algorithmic thinking is a complex cognitive process of thought which may be explored through different strategies.

To provide alternative learning approach for algorithmic thinking, we propose a game-base learning system called Protobot. Protobot requires students to apply their CT knowledge, especially the algorithmic thinking to solve problems in the gameplay. The experimental results demonstrate that Protobot fosters the algorithmic thinking skill of the players as well as provides the amusement during the gameplay.","","978-1-6654-6077-4","10.1109/ICITEE56407.2022.9954081","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9954081","Game-based learning;Digital game-based learning;Procedural content generation;Algorithmic thinking;Computational thinking","Learning systems;Electrical engineering;Biometrics (access control);Education;Games;Internet;Complexity theory","","1","","34","IEEE","23 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

CT is an essential problem-solving skill set in this modern era of digitization and technological advancements. To build students' knowledge and skills in CT while maximizing students' motivation and engagement in learning, a novel online adaptive gamified course called Computational Thinking Quest (CTQ) was introduced. The CTQ was designed and developed by a multidisciplinary team of students and faculty members. The key features of CTQ are (1) an interactive storyline with animated avatars, mini-games, and questions created using Unity three-dimensional cross-platform game engine and Blockly block-based visual programming language; (2) questions at three different levels of difficulty for effective adaptive and self-learning approach; (3) an answer and feedback to each question for increased students' confidence and enthusiasm towards learning; (4) hyperlinks to online learning resources for further reading; (5) a badge and a leaderboard to motivate active participation and encourage success; and (6) a course management system with automatic data saving capability to enable learning at own pace, anytime, anywhere. The CTQ was rolled out to some newly matriculated first-year undergraduate Engineering (ENG) and InfoComm Technology (ICT) students. A total of 54 ENG and 53 ICT students' learning performance and feedback were collated and analyzed. Statistical results from the paired Student's t-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test consistently reveal that (1) the median of post-test marks is significantly higher than that of pre-test marks (p < 0.001); (2) the median of CT knowledge scores after taking CTQ is significantly higher than that of before CTQ (p < 0.001); and (3) the median time taken to complete the post-test is significantly lower than the pre-test (p < 0.001). Furthermore, more than 75% of ENG and ICT students, separately, stated that CTQ is an engaging or very engaging learning platform; 81% of them indicated that the educational content of CTQ is enriching or very enriching; and 83% of them commented that CTQ has motivated independent learning. The CTQ can also serve as a bridging course to narrow the heterogeneity gap among students with heterogeneous prior knowledge on computer programming languages and ease students into programming-related modules, thereby enhancing teaching and learning effectiveness.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637467","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637467","computational thinking;gamification;adaptive learning;independent learning;online education platform","Computer languages;Visualization;Electronic learning;Conferences;Education;Games;Problem-solving","","6","","34","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To bridge this gap, we designed the Computational Thinking Test for Lower Primacy (CTt-LP), targeting students aged 6–8. This study presents the test design, content validation, and pilot testing. For test design, Evidence-Centered Design (ECD) was applied, and four constructs were selected. A total of 30 items were designed, after which content validation was performed via expert judgement and cognitive interviews with students. Revisions were made based on the validation results. The pilot testing was conducted in a public primary school in northern China, with 72 participants from Grade 2.

However, one cannot find intelligent processes by means of physics and chemistry. Natural scientific phenomena follow their deterministic laws, but intelligence is based on selection and decision processes. The conceptual landscape of natural science is optimized for different kinds of phenomena than intelligent information processing. Consequently, the basic research under technology design should be rethought in light of the emergence of AI.

Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620553","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1657002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620553","Equity and inclusion in computing;Computational thinking;Transdisciplinary (CT+X) curriculum models","Computer science;Electric potential;Systematics;Computational modeling;Affordances;Tools;Inspection","","1","","46","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.","","978-1-7281-3470-3","10.1109/e-Engineering47629.2021.9470593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9470593","assessment;computational thinking;introductory programming;psychometric properties","Instruments;Education;Programming;Reliability theory;Tools;Data structures;Pattern recognition","","1","","22","IEEE","2 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds.

Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-8859-1","10.1109/RO-MAN53752.2022.9900775","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9900775","human-robot interaction;mutual understanding;collaborative learning;computational thinking","Learning systems;Costs;Correlation;Federated learning;Collaboration;Humanoid robots;Behavioral sciences","","","","21","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.","","978-1-6654-6077-4","10.1109/ICITEE56407.2022.9954123","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9954123","Waste Separation;Mixed Reality Technology;Environment;Computational Thinking","Waste management;Performance evaluation;Mixed reality;Games;Virtual reality;Media;Problem-solving","","","","22","IEEE","23 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI.

Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962505","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962505","Computational Thinking;Collaboration;Undergraduate Instruction;Qualitative Research;Data Science","Codes;Federated learning;Semantics;Collaboration;Writing;Syntactics;Problem-solving","","","","21","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution.

Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620585","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620585","programming education;computing education;version control systems;GitHub","Knowledge engineering;Industries;Engineering profession;Tools;Machinery;Standards;Programming profession","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The second, ‘user analysis using socialnomics’ looks at how a parametric user model based on the ecological framework can be used to understand users of information systems from the point of view of supporting a digital economy of users. A number of additional equations are developed using socialnomics that can be applied to digital transformation based on the parametric user model, including to calculate probability of seduction and probability of serendipity in an information system.

As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading.

Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability.

For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962606","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962606","Cognitive load;Computational Statistics;Computational Thinking;Subjective Scale;Secondary Task;Working Memory","Presses;Correlation;Keyboards;Cognitive load;Task analysis;Programming profession","","1","","14","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a literature review conducted to identify the interventions used to develop CT skills and the methods used to assess CT skills. The review explored various publications on CT and identified that curriculum-based interventions and workshops are the primary interventions used for introducing CT in the educational sector. During the analysis, we have also identified a handful of assessment tools used for measuring CT skills, but they are not standardized assessment tools.

Rural children in India, in particular, have a natural way of telling stories that are rooted in their heritage of social norms, values, and belief systems that are compelling and emotionally engaging. The process of writing and narrating their own stories enhances their verbal proficiency and makes them reflect deeply upon the story theme, thereby enabling them to develop higher-order thinking. In this research study, the author used stories to introduce physical computing and robotics to children in rural India in a personally meaningful manner. Children created interactive cultural dioramas based on classical stories from Indian folklore with robotic puppets that they programmed using the Scratch programming language. They learned 21st-century skills of creativity, communication, collaboration, and critical thinking by working in groups wherein they learned to divide tasks, manage time, work together, debate the pros and cons of different ideas, listen, think out of the box, and be active and engaged. The author observed that such an intervention improved the children's sense of agency and their interest in robotics and computational thinking. The author presents her results from pilot studies conducted in 2019 from two semi-urban schools in India on the children's perception of creating robots, programming, tinkering with electronics, career in robotics, and the workshop experience itself - all of which suggests that the children were deeply engaged and enthusiastic throughout the workshop making the entire learning experience a meaningful and joyful one for all. The results indicate that such culturally sensitive interventions can help children from collectivistic cultures embrace technology while preserving their traditional identities and cultural cohesion.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637460","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637460","STEM;Physical Computing;Robotics Education;21st Century Skills;Middle School Education;K-12 education","Conferences;Collaboration;Writing;Robot sensing systems;Cultural differences;Global communication;Task analysis","","5","","37","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although ER being used to develop CT, there are still no guidelines based on scientific studies that support this use. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) the main pedagogical approaches are applied in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; b) the central difficulties are encountered in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; c) the CT skills are presents in classes with ER focused on developing students' CT; d) the instruments are used to assess students' CT during classes with ER; e) the students' profile who participated in classes with ER focused o on developing students' CT; f) the educational robotics technologies are adopted in classes focused on developing students' CT. To achieve these goals, we planned and carried out systematic mapping of the literature. The results show that, through ER, CT is approached through the teaching of programming languages in a collaborative way in Early Childhood and High School. The most CT skills observed are related to programming, such as sequencing, algorithm, loop, generalization, decomposition, and debugging. The main instruments for assessing students are tests, and the most significant difficulty is the limitation of class hours.

While computational thinking theory is still developing, empirical studies can help further understand how students demonstrate this knowledge and their progression in attaining the practices. Therefore, with this empirical study, the following questions are addressed. RQ1: What are the differences in students' computational thinking practices at the beginning of an undergraduate introductory programming course? RQ 2: How do these differences correspond to the acquisition of more advanced computational thinking practices? The use of a descriptive non-experimental design that aims to understand the correlation between practices related to data and computational problem-solving is presented. A machine learning technique is employed, utilizing historical data from introductory programming for a problem-solving course with more than 1000 first-year engineering students. After identifying groups of students defining different profiles, data from posterior performance in more advanced programming topics were descriptively analyzed. This study supports the characterization of four different student profiles demonstrating differences in their performance at the beginning of the semester. From these four profiles, two of them show a subsequent differential progression besides their similarity at the beginning of the semester. In this particular case, troubleshooting and debugging appear as a relevant competency when distinguishing these two learners' groups.

However, the current research on how to construct the evaluation indicators is still inadequate, and most of the research is put forward by the subjective experience of researchers, lacking objectivity and the universality of ability. In the paper, we comprehensively reviewed the concepts of CT in the theoretical literature of CT, aiming to construct the comprehensive and effective evaluation indicators of CT for students by clustering the keywords of CT concepts and extracting indicators. The validity of indicators is verified by qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis and expert evaluation. The results show that the evaluation indicators of CT constructed by spectral clustering technology are a more scientific, more comprehensive reflection of the ability dimensions of CT. It has unique advantages in constructing objective and comprehensive evaluation indicators and provides an evaluation basis for the evaluation practice of CT skills.","","978-1-6654-8048-2","10.1109/ICIET55102.2022.9779003","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61977031); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9779003","CT concepts;spectral clustering;evaluation indicators;CT practice;CT perspective","Statistical analysis;Education;Clustering algorithms;Reflection;Computational efficiency","","","","24","IEEE","26 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A number of these projects have made equity a central goal of their work by working in schools with diverse racial, linguistic, and economic diversity. However, we know little about whether and how teachers equitably engage students in CT during their classroom instruction-particularly during science and math lessons. In this paper, we present an approach to analyzing classroom instructional videos using the EQUIP tool (https://www.equip.ninja/). The purpose of this tool is to examine the quantity and quality of students' contributions during CT-integrated math and science lessons and how it differs based on demographic markers.

Most existent autograders are based on unit testing, which focuses on the correctness of the code, but has limited scope for judging code quality. Moreover, it is cumbersome to implement unit testing for evaluating graphical output code. We propose an autograder that can effectively judge the code quality of the visual output codes created by students enrolled in a high school-level computational thinking course. We aim to provide suggestions to teachers on an essential aspect of their grading, namely the level of student com-petency in using abstraction within their codes.

SCRaMbLE relies on artificial evolution in vitro to identify useful variants, an approach which is time consuming and expensive. We developed an in silico simulator for the SCRaMbLE system, using an evolutionary computing approach, which can be used to investigate and optimize the fitness landscape of the system. We applied the system to the investigation of the fitness landscape of one of the S. cerevisiae chromosomes, and found that our results fitted well with those previously published.

The learning of computational thinking was measured through the following dimensions: algorithmic thinking-sequences, abstraction-patterns and debugging. The learning activities used were an adaptation of the activities proposed in the “TangibleK” robotics curriculum. The results generated show positive effects in relation to the level of achievement reached by the students in the proposed challenges; in other words, there is a significant effect on the mastery of skills related to computational thinking. Differences were found between the pretest and posttest measures of the experimental group. Those of the latter group were statistically significant and higher than those of the control group.

Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.","1558-0687","","10.1109/MWC.001.2000250","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9265517","","Computational modeling;Wireless communication;Ubiquitous computing;Internet of Things;Optimization;Wireless sensor networks;Predictive models;Decision making","","9","","18","IEEE","23 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2019.2908172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8676257","Focused attention meditation;mindfulness;sustained attention;SART;Prims;transfer;emotion regulation","Computational modeling;Mood;Monitoring;Mathematical model;Predictive models;Emotion recognition","","4","","60","IEEE","29 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.","2161-377X","978-1-6654-9519-6","10.1109/ICALT55010.2022.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9853848","Natural Language;Computational Thinking;Conceptual Programming;eLearning;Logic First Syntax Later","Java;Codes;Instruments;Natural languages;Syntactics;Impedance;Programming profession","","2","","8","IEEE","17 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Do Structured Flowcharts Outperform Pseudocode? Evidence From Eye Movements","M. Andrzejewska; A.

One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3230981","Scientific Research Fund of the Pedagogical University of Krakow; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9994685","Coding;computational thinking;eye tracking;flowchart;pseudocode;solving algorithmic problems","Flowcharts;Codes;Gaze tracking;Task analysis;Computer languages;Education;Programming profession","","3","","40","CCBY","20 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637147","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior – Brasil (CAPES); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637147","Computer Science;Computational Thinking;Citizen Science;Ontology","Computer science;Vocabulary;Visualization;Computational modeling;Conferences;Education;Collaboration","","","","33","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637257","Japan Society for the Promotion of Science KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP19K02985); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637257","programming education;teaching material;assessment tool;Computational Thinking;elementary school","Visualization;Education;Tactile sensors;Light emitting diodes;Encoding;Sensors;Servomotors","","","","23","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

During the first two years of participation in the Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways Research Practice Partnership (CT Pathways), the district developed a computing pathways document to guide schools and teachers in the integration of computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT). After a year piloting their pathway, an Inclusive CT Pathways Committee was formed to review the existing pathways document and ensure it was ably addressing the district's overall equity goal of better serving students from Black and Latinx communities. As an orientation step to personalize this goal and understand it within the context of their own classrooms and schools, teachers on the Inclusive CT Committee conducted empathy interviews to learn more about the computing experiences of their students. Teachers reflected upon the structure of the interview protocol, the insights they gained, and the potential opportunities the approach afforded them to address misconceptions about computing. They described the interviews as opportunities to learn more about designing supports, on-ramps, and more inclusive computing opportunities for students.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620708","computing pathways;computational thinking;empathy interviews;inclusive computing","Computer science;Protocols;Instruments;Urban areas;Interviews","","","","9","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As computer science (CS) and computational thinking (CT) education pathways increasingly develop in rural districts, it is essential to provide quality PD for their teachers so they can identify opportunities for and plan to embed CS and CT learning in their classrooms. A key element in delivering high-quality PD is understanding the specific educational and wider cultural needs of the community where it will be delivered, something we call “mining cultural capital”. In this poster, we report on the delivery of four 30-minute virtual PD sessions within two rural school districts in Eastern Kentucky: Pikeville Independent and Floyd County Schools. The virtual sessions were specifically geared toward elementary and middle school teachers. The sessions were led by a long-time educator in the region who worked to curate relevant examples and delivered the PD via a recorded video conference. The recordings are available for teachers in the region to watch and re-watch as they develop their lessons. Survey results showed that participating teachers found the PD to be valuable. Furthermore, feedback from teachers suggests that access to these short just-in-time PD sessions provided valuable learning opportunities and also sparked new lesson ideas for teachers.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620568","rural education;computing pathways;equitable access to computer science education;computational thinking;professional development;broadening participation in computing","Computer science;Handheld computers;Education;Global communication;Cultural differences;Videoconferences","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

But teachers want to know how they can do this on top of their existing priorities. In this paper, we describe how our research-practice partnership is working to motivate, prepare, and support an elementary school to integrate equitable and inclusive computer science into core curriculum. Data were collected from teachers at a K-5 school where 65 % of students are Hispanic or Latinx, 46% are English Learners, and 65 % are eligible for free or reduced lunch. Data included semi-structured interviews, educators' written reflections, and observations of classroom implementation and professional development. The findings show how the school is building buy-in and capacity among teachers by using a coaching cycle led by a Teacher on Special Assignment. The cycle of preparation, implementation, and reflection demystifies CS by helping teachers design, test, and revise coherent lesson sequences that integrate CT into their lessons. Contrasting case studies are used to illustrate what teachers learned from the cycle, including the teachers' reasons for the integration, adaptations they made to promote equity, what the teachers noticed about their students engaging in CT, and their next steps. We discuss the strengths and the limitations of this approach to bringing CS for All.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620555","NSF(grant numbers:1923606); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620555","teacher professional development;elementary school;computational thinking;equity and inclusion","Computer science;Education;Buildings;Reflection;Interviews","","","","7","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite the benefits virtual human medical simulations provide, previous work suggests that users struggle to notice when virtual humans make potentially life-threatening verbal communication mistakes inside virtual human medical simulations. In this work, we performed a 2x2 mixed design user study that had learners (n = 80) attempt to identify verbal communication mistakes made by a virtual human acting as a nurse in a virtual desktop environment. A virtual desktop environment was used instead of a head-mounted virtual reality environment due to Covid-19 limitations. The virtual desktop environment experience allowed us to explore how frequently learners identify verbal communication mistakes in virtual human medical simulations and how perceptions of credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness in the virtual human affect learner error recognition rates. We found that learners struggle to identify infrequent virtual human verbal communication mistakes. Additionally, learners with lower initial trustworthiness ratings are more likely to overlook potentially life-threatening mistakes, and virtual human mistakes temporarily lower learner credibility, reliability, and trustworthiness ratings of virtual humans. From these findings, we provide insights on improving virtual human medical simulation design. Developers can use these insights to design virtual simulations for error identification training using virtual humans.","2642-5254","978-1-6654-9617-9","10.1109/VR51125.2022.00065","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9756762","Human-centered computing;Empirical studies in HCI","Training;Human computer interaction;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Medical simulation;Conferences;Computational modeling","","1","","33","IEEE","20 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While Scratch has been found to increase students' motivation and interest in programming, it has been debated whether Scratch users practice and learn about core programming concepts such as loops, conditional expressions, procedures and variables. This paper presents a large scale study of the progression of the programming concepts practiced by Scratch users through an analysis of their complete public project portfolios. A dataset of over 112 thousand authors and their 1 million projects was constructed and analyzed from three viewpoints. First, we investigate the development of programming concepts by looking at block usage statistics for each project in the users' repositories. Second, we score and analyze the dataset using a computational thinking rubric. Third, we identify users that have left the Scratch platform and evaluate the learning goals they have achieved. Our results show that, while users progress in Scratch, there is a positive trend in the use of all concepts that were examined. Within the least utilized concepts, even after the 20th project of Scratch users, are procedures, conditional loops and logic operations. Examining the users who have left the Scratch platform after creating at least the mean amount of nine projects, we measured that half had left without ever utilizing procedures, and a third had left without ever utilizing conditional loops.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453973","Programming education;Scratch;Game development;Computational Thinking;K-12","Conferences;Games;Programming;Market research;Software;Trajectory;Engineering education","","4","","27","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, educators feel that they miss opportunities, skills, and tools to support pupils developing creativity. Hence, we proposed a digital learning environment, named Novelette, to support both educators and learners in performing visual storytelling by scaffolding them in inventing and authoring stories. The main novelty of our approach lies in embedding literary artifices widely explored in learning settings into a digital learning environment, such as the opportunity to continue someone else’s story and the suggestion mechanism to explore analogies or synonyms starting from a word of interest. Novelette has been ideated not only as a learning environment for educators, but with educators, as it results from a user-centered and participatory design methodology to involve them in the entire design and development process actively. This paper focuses on the assessment of Novelette usability according to both educators and pupils. As a conclusive step of the co-design approach, developers tested the resulting usability according to educators in a controlled environment. Moreover, it reports usability according to learners in real settings at school. Results demonstrate that Novelette is considered usable by both target groups, and it is perceived as a powerful approach in developing creativity both according to quantitative insight offered by the System Usability Scale, a.k.a., SUS, and qualitative interpretations enabled with direct observations and structured after scenario questionnaires. We can conclude that Novelette is a pleasant and usable tool to invent and author stories and seems to be a promising approach to develop creativity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9661274","Collaborative design;digital learning environment;digital storytelling;education;usability","Usability;Pupils;Creativity;Media;Visualization;Collaboration;Problem-solving","","7","","72","CCBY","22 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The measurements of a GMTI radar are range, azimuth, and radial velocity, which are nonlinear functions of the Cartesian target and sensor states. In our 2003 SPIE paper we analyzed the performance of the converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF), extended Kalman filter (EKF), unscented Kalman filter (UKF), and transition density based particle filter (TD-PF). In this paper, we extend our previous work by considering the cubature Kalman filter (CKF). We also compute the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) to judge the accuracy of the filters relative to the best achievable accuracy. The results of this analysis are useful in an operational system where a filter has to chosen based on state estimation accuracy, scalability, and computational complexity. We also analyze the accuracy of the TD-PF by varying the number of particles. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the accuracy and computational complexity of various filters. Based on the root time-averaged mean square (RTAMS) error of position and velocity, we find that the CMKF, EKF, UKF, and CKF have nearly the same accuracy in cases analyzed. To achieve the same level of accuracy, the TD-PF requires more than 40,000 particles with about 508 times more computational cost relative to the EKF. Contrary to conventional thinking, our results show that for cases analyzed the EKF produces the best accuracy with stable performance and lowest computational cost.","2475-7896","978-1-6654-4029-5","10.1109/ICCAIS52680.2021.9624559","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9624559","Ground moving target indicator (GMTI) radar;converted measurement based Kalman filter (CMKF);EKF;UKF;CKF;transition density based particle filter (TD-PF);posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound (PCRLB)","Atmospheric measurements;Radar;Filtering algorithms;Radar tracking;Particle measurements;Particle filters;Computational efficiency","","5","","37","IEEE","9 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One crucial aspect in this regard is the perceptions that students hold on the subject as well as on Computing in general. Various studies have been carried out to measure students' attitudes towards Computing. However, assessing the understanding of CT and Computing attitudes in undergraduate education, and particularly in teacher education, has not been fully explored yet. Most current instruments are either not aimed at educators or not designed to cover elements related to both CT and Computing. In this work, our goal was to evaluate a survey instrument on perceptions of CT and attitudes towards Computing for undergraduate students. Our evaluation focused on verifying whether the instrument could grasp the aspects involved in five different intended constructs: 1) understanding of CT, 2) application of CT in classroom, 3) confidence to learn Computing, 4) interest for Computing and 5) perception of Computing usefulness. After applying the instrument with 2,290 undergraduate students, we computed its reliability and used confirmatory factor analysis results to measure its validity. Results showed evidence that the instrument is both reliable and valid to measure impressions of CT and Computing attitudes in an educational context.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453940","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453940","","Instruments;Current measurement;Conferences;Reliability;Engineering education","","2","","18","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Saliency detection has gained intensive interest with the aim of resembling human ‘perceptual’ system. However, saliency related to human ‘cognition’, particularly the analysis of complex salient regions (‘cogitating’ process), is yet to be fully exploited. We propose to resemble human cognition, coupled with human perception, to improve saliency detection. We recognize saliency in three phases (‘Seeing’ - ‘Perceiving’ - ‘Cogitating), mimicking human's perceptive and cognitive thinking of an image. In our method, ‘Seeing’ phase is related to human perception, and we formulate the ‘Perceiving’ and ‘Cogitating’ phases related to the human cognition systems via deep neural networks (DNNs) to construct a new module (Cognitive Gate) that enhances the DNN features for saliency detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that established DNNs to resemble human cognition for saliency detection. In our experiments, our approach outperformed 17 benchmarking DNN methods on six well-recognized datasets, demonstrating that resembling human cognition improves saliency detection.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2021.3068277","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9384320","Cognition;image processing;neural networks;object detection","Cognition;Saliency detection;Visualization;Feature extraction;Logic gates;Benchmark testing;Heating systems","Algorithms;Cognition;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer","2","","102","IEEE","23 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The research presented herein is a first attempt to define a difficulty function for maze-based programming challenges using log data obtained from Kodetu, which is a block-based maze game. Specifically, we conducted three studies with 9- to 16-year-old students who were asked to solve sequences of maze-based programming challenges. Using log data from these studies, we investigated the maze characteristics and the coding limitations that affect performance in the challenges and calculated the performance obtained by the participants using a fuzzy rule-based system. The results showed that the turns in a maze, the number of total steps of a maze, and the blocks provided affect student performance.

"Data vault modelling as alternative to dimensional modelling to embrace complexity in data driven decision systems: a critical systems perspective","R.

Today's compelling business problem is replaced tomorrow with a problem which was not even imagined yesterday. Data driven decision systems are used by managers in support of their strategic decisions and should be agile and flexibility to survive in our ever change world of complex decisions. The argument presented in this conceptual paper is that data vault modeling is inherently better equipped than dimensional modelling to handle the turbulations of our complex world. The paper investigates the underlying assumptions of dimensional modelling and data vault modelling in terms of requirements collection and the resulting data modelling techniques. It uses critical systems thinking as guiding philosophy to reflect on the benefits of understanding and modelling a variety of perspectives in a problem situation. Critical systems thinking also promotes equal opportunity and accountability. It is argued that both these aspirations can better be achieved by using dimensional modeling as alternative to dimensional modelling. We hope to promote the development of sustainable data driven decision systems which can stand the test of our turbulent times.","","978-1-6654-5305-9","10.1109/CSDE56538.2022.10089249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10089249","data driven decision systems;data vault modelling;dimensional modelling;critical systems thinking","Computer science;Uncertainty;Philosophical considerations;Computational modeling;Data engineering;Data models;Equal opportunities","","","","18","IEEE","6 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The users are demanding more from the existing computing systems in terms of the computational power. The inherent nature of distributed computing enables the distribution of computationally expensive work across various available resources. Due to the distribution of the resources across multiple locations, there exists the challenge of discovering, synthesizing, and facilitating the resources to the client requests. In addition, the discovered resources must also comply with user requests to the diversely available resources along with their current information. In this paper, we aim to explore the resource discovery domain in the area of distributed computing and study the recent proposed schemes. We provide a survey of the distributed networking architecture and inherent discovery techniques. Furthermore, a critical analysis and comparison of the studied approaches is provided considering their networking architecture and the discovery technique.","","978-1-6654-8945-4","10.1109/ICIT56493.2022.9989068","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9989068","distributed computing;resource discovery;net-work structures","Computer architecture;Distributed computing","","","","21","IEEE","30 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unsupervised learning technique gives the opportunity of learning from data by producing different patterns. It is also a concern of increasing realistic imagination in terms of implementation of artificial imagination like human imagination. This paper aims to review the relationship between artificial imagination and human imagination alongside the overview of implementing artificial imagination using modern machine learning algorithms.

Nevertheless, challenges from both data and knowledge aspects remain as obstacles, constraining the social media-based detection performance. Data implicitness and sparsity make it difficult to discover the inner true intentions of individuals based on their posts. Inspired by psychological studies, we build and unify a high-level suicide-oriented knowledge graph with deep neural networks for suicidal ideation detection on social media.

The review analyzes different methods and tools at different educational levels and with different objectives. Background: Learning programming has gained relevance in the last decade. This is due to the massive presence of programmable elements ranging from computers to toys. Because of this, the interest of researchers on this topic has increased. Questions, such as what to use, in what educational stages to use it, the effectiveness of the method, and the focal objectives for learning programming are questions that do not have obvious answers. Research Questions: 1) What empirical evidence exists on the use of educational programming languages (EPLs)? 2) In what context is the research performed? 3) How is effectiveness reported in the literature after applying EPLs? 4) What pedagogical goals are achieved by using EPLs? Methodology: Following a formal protocol, automated searches were performed for primary studies from 2007 to 2018. A total of 62 studies were identified, of which 29 were selected and analyzed since they include some type of empirical evidence. Findings: After performing the evaluation, the results support the need for better approaches with empirical evidence when reporting research on the usage of EPLs. Some research opportunities are identified which concerns the used programming languages, the areas or stages of their application, or the need to have more empirical evidence in general and more studies in non-WEIRD (Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic) contexts.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2020.3030588","EU FEDER Program; MINECO Project OPHELIA(grant numbers:RTI2018-101204-B-C22); TASOVA Network(grant numbers:MCIU-AEI TIN2017-90644-REDT); Junta de Andalucia METAMORFOSIS Project; ECLIPSE Project(grant numbers:RTI2018-094283-B-C33); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF/FEDER); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9249431","Computational thinking (CT);educational programming language (EPL);programming learning","Programming profession;Databases;Computer languages;Bibliographies;Tools;Protocols","","1","","48","IEEE","5 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Robofest is a worldwide robotics competition program for students in 4th-12th grade and college. Student teams design, construct, and program their autonomous robots in a variety of competition categories. In the 2019–2020 academic year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an innovative and novel online robotics competition format using Zoom Webinar tools rather than cancelling the world championship competition. The purpose of this paper is to show how we designed, implemented synchronized online robotics competitions, and to analyze the results and efficacy of the Robofest Online World championships (ROWC). One hundred and fifty-three teams comprising of 360 students competed in three age divisions and six categories held weekends from Aug. 28 through Oct. 10, 2020. Most teams set up playing fields at home and we trained judges online prior to the competitions. We sent the description of an unknown game ending task and unknown playing field factors to local volunteer judges at the same time just before the 30-minute work time on the competition day. After checking to make sure that all the teams were ready to play, we sent the game start signal to all the teams at the same time through Zoom. The local judges scored the runs and submitted videos to the Robofest office for score verification. Robofest office staff also proctored the competitions through Zoom screens for fair competition results and maximum learning opportunities. It was an innovative practice of using online conference tools to organize the world's first unique “synchronized” online autonomous robotics competitions for engineering and computing education. Anonymous coach & judge survey results after the ROWC showed that the satisfaction rate was better than the in-person competition surveys of previous years. Additionally, 95 % of students surveyed after the ROWC exposure said that they would now consider a career involving STEM versus 91 % of students surveyed after the 2019 in-person competitions.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637399","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637399","online robotics competition;autonomous robotics;computational thinking;computer science and engineering education;virtual robotics;online learning environment;STEM education;synchronized online competition;online competition methodologies","Pandemics;Engineering profession;Education;Games;Webinars;Synchronization;Task analysis","","","","17","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We illustrate how the approach can be applied to automatize the human assessment of an activity developed for testing computational thinking skills.

Hence, it requires a high-level reasoning ability that understands the relationships between objects in the given text and generates high-quality images based on the understanding. Text-to-image translation can be termed as the visual thinking of neural networks. In this study, our model infers the complicated relationships between objects in the given text and generates the final image by leveraging the previous history. We define diverse novel adversarial loss functions and finally demonstrate the best one that elevates the reasoning ability of the text-to-image synthesis.

As part of this programme, University of Glasgow hosted the EPSRC’s first conference on this topic - “Looking Beyond Industry 4.0”. The success of this programme led to another round of £ 1m funding for “Connected Everything II: Accelerating Digital Manufacturing Research Collaboration and Innovation” (2019-22), so as “to make the most of this fourth industrial revolution”. The first three Industrial Revolutions took place a posteriori, and mostly, were concerned with assisting and liberating humans from physical labour. Today, should the a priori Industry 4.0 differ from the previous industrial revolutions? If so, would the difference be in a focus on assisting and liberating humans from mental labour for the first time? The recent World Economic Forum highlighted four main design principles of this revolution: (1) Interoperability, (2) Information transparency, (3) Cognitive and physical assistance (4) Decentralised decisions and actions. Coinciding with this wave of revolution is the third wave of artificial intelligence (AI), which is currently in its earnest resurgence. It is now possible to develop computational AI technology to surpass a human designer in innovation and creativity, just like AlphaGo Zero in London to have surpassed AlphaGo and humans in Go playing. The progress of science and technology now heavily relies on simulation-based ‘third paradigm of science’ in the form of ‘computer-aided design’ (CAD). AI can transform CAD simulations to predictive simulations for ‘computer-automated design’ (CAutoD), which becomes possible through AI with the increased computing power and data. Thus, CAutoD should help Industry 4.0 to achieve mass customisation at a mass production cost in the near future. However, design, manufacturing and service all need to be taken into account for factory-floor innovation in order to deliver transformative improvements in performance, productivity and time-to-market. Commensurate with the ‘intelligent manufacturing’ value chain and ‘market informatics’ at the end of this value chain, such Industry 4.0 would enhance innovation, creativity and competitiveness.","","978-1-6654-9807-4","10.1109/ICAC55051.2022.9911063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911063","","Productivity;Technological innovation;Solid modeling;Computational modeling;Transforms;Predictive models;Data models","","","","0","IEEE","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It takes place through various considerations such as emotional representation in their behavioral patterns, facial expressions, head pose, body stance, and so on. Deciding on the emotional state of a virtual human at a moment, however, is still a challenge. Computational models of emotion, stemming from appraisal theories, are suggested for modeling emotion in virtual agents. Despite their competence in extracting emotion from appraisal values, they are poorly defined in describing how to assess appraisal values within a sense-think-act behavior model. Motivated by this lack of empirical knowledge on the appraisal stage, in this preliminary work, we propose a framework to bridge the gap between a computational model of emotion and a behavior model of virtual humans. To this end, we use a need-based, goal- oriented, autonomous behavior model to generate salient stimuli for eliciting emotions. Our simulation of a case study suggests that the proposed framework can produce sensible emotional states that conform to the essential principles of appraisal-based emotion theories.","2771-7453","978-1-6654-5725-5","10.1109/AIVR56993.2022.00027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10024444","virtual humans;emotion generation;appraisal theory;behavior modeling","Solid modeling;Emotion recognition;Computational modeling;Virtual reality;User experience;Appraisal;Behavioral sciences","","1","","27","IEEE","30 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Machines That Feel and Think: The Role of Affective Feelings and Mental Action in (Artificial) General Intelligence","G. Deane","University of Edinburgh, School of Philosophy, Psychology, and Language Sciences.",Artificial Life,"30 Oct 2023","2022","28","3","289","309","What role do affective feelings (feelings/emotions/moods) play in adaptive behaviour? What are the implications of this for understanding and developing artificial general intelligence? Leading theoretical models of brain function are beginning to shed light on these questions. While artificial agents have excelled within narrowly circumscribed and specialised domains, domain-general intelligence has remained an elusive goal in artificial intelligence research. By contrast, humans and nonhuman animals are characterised by a capacity for flexible behaviour and general intelligence. In this article I argue that computational models of mental phenomena in predictive processing theories of the brain are starting to reveal the mechanisms underpinning domain-general intelligence in biological agents, and can inform the understanding and development of artificial general intelligence. I focus particularly on approaches to computational phenomenology in the active inference framework. Specifically, I argue that computational mechanisms of affective feelings in active inference—affective self-modelling—are revealing of how biological agents are able to achieve flexible behavioural repertoires and general intelligence. I argue that (i) affective self-modelling functions to “tune” organisms to the most tractable goals in the environmental context; and (ii) affective and agentic self-modelling is central to the capacity to perform mental actions in goal-directed imagination and creative cognition. I use this account as a basis to argue that general intelligence of the level and kind found in biological agents will likely require machines to be implemented with analogues of affective self-modelling.","1064-5462","","10.1162/artl_a_00368","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10301935","Active inference;artificial intelligence;emotion;self-modelling;general intelligence;computational phenomenology","","","","","","","30 Oct 2023","","","MIT Press","MIT Press Journals"

This paper proposes a re-thinking ASR model, which aims to bridge the gap by rethinking the regularities of a given hypothesis and the relationship between text-level and acoustic-level characteristics of the input speech utterance. For the re-thinking ASR model, a mixed attention mechanism, a self-and-mixed attention mechanism, and a deep acoustic feature extractor are meticulously designed to enable the notion to be realized. A publicly available benchmark corpus is used to evaluate the proposed model. As the experimental results demonstrate, the proposed re-thinking ASR model can provide significant and consistent improvements over popular baseline systems.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671417","Ministry of Science and Technology; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671417","","Training;Computational modeling;Conferences;Benchmark testing;Big Data;Parallel processing;Feature extraction","","","","51","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

On the other hand, learners must be versatile onto a complementary and complex environment in which the virtual meets the traditional lectures. Moreover, when the learning ecosystem includes children and younger newbies with technologies and gadgets is promising the adoption of targeted approaches such as gamification, playful activities and/or high interactive and supportive learning. This study presents the introduction of game-based learning techniques for young children at Cape Verde, with 17 students aged from 4 to 11 years, using the Code Karts app. Pre- and post-assessments measured familiarity with technology, appeal of the coding app, ability to play Code Karts, conceptual understanding of coding, and in-class behaviours. Results revealed that children prefer haptic interfaces to interact with technological devices. Congruently, the adoption of mobile phones and tablets was easier at the expense of the use of laptops. In addition, the proposed learning methodology, based on gamification principles, was determinant to promote in-class interaction and tutor-children interaction. In addition, gamification was crucial for the learning outcomes and to provide insight on programming.

By incorporating a parameter-sharing strategy, ALBERT greatly reduces the number of parameters while achieving competitive performance. Nevertheless, ALBERT still suffers from a long inference time. In this work, we propose the ELBERT, which significantly improves the average inference speed compared to ALBERT due to the proposed confidence-window based early exit mechanism, without introducing additional parameters or extra training overhead. Experimental results show that ELBERT achieves an adaptive inference speedup varying from 2× to 10× with negligible accuracy degradation compared to AL-BERT on various datasets. Besides, ELBERT achieves higher accuracy than existing early exit methods used for accelerating BERT under the same computation cost.

After critically reviewing the three challenges, this paper proposes alternative regulatory approaches to address each of these regulatory challenges. To address the definition challenge, we propose a multidimensional approach to defining AI. We argue that a relational approach can be helpful for making visible the cultural context in which AI systems are embedded.

However, the current analysis of the impact of the external environment on emergency repairs is not in-depth, resulting in its model not being able to fully reflect the actual circumstances of the distribution network emergency repairs under the background of disasters, making the actual feasibility of the strategies developed poorly.

Game-based environments are often used to develop these skills, but they lack sufficient voluntariness to assess aspects related to intrinsic motivation, such as interests, skills, persistence in solving a problem and behavior in response to rewards. These aspects directly affect achievement and academic performance, so it is necessary to analyze possible age and gender differences in order to adjust Computational Thinking curricula. With this aim, we deployed a voluntary video game which addresses basic computational concepts, based on intrinsic motivation, and aimed at early ages. Data were collected and analyzed using game learning analytics for 15 months, during which 4124 users played more than 28187 games. The analysis shows significant age and gender differences in relation to interests, skills, achievement, and progression through attempts. It was observed that the concepts addressed were achievable between the ages of 3 and 6 years and full mastery was possible by the age of 4 years, regardless of gender, as children persist with the challenge, intrinsically motivated, until it is overcome. In terms of persistence, significantly different behaviors were observed in the face of the challenge, which can help us to adjust the different learning methodologies to each age group and gender, adapting the way we provide reinforcement and rewards, especially for boys in the more complex challenges and for girls from the age of 5 years onwards.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3110475","Madrid Regional Government through the Project e-Madrid-CM(grant numbers:S2018/TCS-4307); European Structural and Investment Funds, namely the European Social Fund (FSE) and the European Regional Development Fund (FEDER); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9529183","Computational thinking;early ages;game learning analytics;interests;intrinsic motivation;learn to program;persistence;rewards;skills;video games","Games;Education;Programming profession;Data mining;Problem-solving;Tools","","14","","65","CCBY","3 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Engineering such molecular computing systems is a major challenge for synthetic biology and related fields. The chemical reaction network (CRN) model idealizes chemical interactions, allowing rigorous reasoning about the computational power of chemical kinetics. Here we focus on function computation with CRNs, where we think of the initial concentrations of some species as the input and the equilibrium concentration of another species as the output. Specifically, we are concerned with CRNs that are rate-independent (the computation must be correct independent of the reaction rate law) and composable ($f\circ g$f∘g can be computed by concatenating the CRNs computing $f$f and $g$g). Rate independence and composability are important engineering desiderata, permitting implementations that violate mass-action kinetics, or even “well-mixedness”, and allowing the systematic construction of complex computation via modular design. We show that to construct composable rate-independent CRNs, it is necessary and sufficient to ensure that the output species of a module is not a reactant in any reaction within the module. We then exactly characterize the functions computable by such CRNs as superadditive, positive-continuous, and piecewise rational linear. Thus composability severely limits rate-independent computation unless more sophisticated input/output encodings are used.","1557-9964","","10.1109/TCBB.2019.2952836","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1618895,CCF-1652824); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8896008","","Chemicals;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Biological information theory;Synthetic biology;Kinetic theory;Encoding","Biochemical Phenomena;Kinetics;Models, Chemical;Synthetic Biology","2","","14","IEEE","11 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Machine learning is increasingly included in computing curricula in higher education, and a quickly growing number of initiatives are expanding it in K-12 computing education, too. As machine learning enters K-12 computing education, understanding how intuition and agency in the context of such systems is developed becomes a key research area. But as schools and teachers are already struggling with integrating traditional computational thinking and traditional artificial intelligence into school curricula, understanding the challenges behind teaching machine learning in K-12 is an even more daunting challenge for computing education research. Despite the central position of machine learning and AI in the field of modern computing, the computing education research body of literature contains remarkably few studies of how people learn to train, test, improve, and deploy machine learning systems. This is especially true of the K-12 curriculum space. This article charts the emerging trajectories in educational practice, theory, and technology related to teaching machine learning in K-12 education. The article situates the existing work in the context of computing education in general, and describes some differences that K-12 computing educators should take into account when facing this challenge. The article focuses on key aspects of the paradigm shift that will be required in order to successfully integrate machine learning into the broader K-12 computing curricula.

Multiple aspects of an AI system can be explained; these include biases that the data might have, lack of data points in a particular region of the example space, fairness of gathering the data, feature importances, etc. However, besides these, it is critical to have human-centered explanations directly related to decision-making, similar to how a domain expert makes decisions based on “domain knowledge,” including well-established, peer-validated explicit guidelines. To understand and validate an AI system's outcomes (such as classification, recommendations, predictions) that lead to developing trust in the AI system, it is necessary to involve explicit domain knowledge that humans understand and use.

They communicate through synapses. Few important things governed by brain are memory, emotions, creativity, intelligence etc. The human mind has three fundamental functions like figure out, react and relish. These functions of the mind are guided by one native egocentrism or potential rational capacities. Egocentric inclination happens involuntarily. ASD better termed as developmental delays. It can cause challenges in social interaction, behaviour and communication. Diagnosis of Autism includes both psychological and neurological examination. Early detection of the neurological markers with the help of MRI can help in to more accurate diagnosis. A combination of S-MRI (Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging), fMRI (Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) and Rs-fMRI (Resting State- Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging) can help in learning all characteristics of brain. Full brain connectivity and signal intensities of Region of Interest can be acquired using various atlases. ASD destroys the structure of the functional connectivity between the multiple brain regions. Deep learning methods proves to be successful in classification of imaging data. Provided with multi modal details provided by different MRI procedures, using a deep learning network can provide accurate classification results. Graph Convolutional Neural Networks can help in classifying whether the person has ASD or not. Given a FC matrix of the brain it is really huge to differentiate the significant features. Thus, it is requiring for dimensionality reduction. So, the purpose of using deep learning model using MRI is to identify Autism in early stage and to start with therapies.","","978-1-6654-3277-1","10.1109/ICCCSP52374.2021.9465490","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9465490","Autism;Deep Learning;MRI;Graph Convolutional Neural Network","Deep learning;Dimensionality reduction;Autism;Computational modeling;Psychology;Medical treatment;Functional magnetic resonance imaging","","3","","13","IEEE","29 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, during the implementation process, many students were not clear about their learning goals and did not like to discuss research with their classmates. It leads to learning to stay on the surface of formality. In order to solve the above problems and improve the effect of group cooperative learning, many researchers have conducted extensive explorations from the perspective of tools and strategies. Among them, the knowledge graph can visualize the relationship between knowledge points. It characterizes the changes in students' cognitive status during the learning process, guides learners to construct knowledge autonomously, and provides the possibility to solve problems such as the confusion of knowledge structure. At the same time, studies have shown that collaborative knowledge construction has a significant promotion effect on teachers' online learning, and is beneficial to teachers' professional development. Technologically supported collaborative knowledge construction can not only promote the efficiency of knowledge acquisition, but also enhance the effect of communication and interaction, and increase the degree of participation in learning. It is an effective method to enhance the depth and breadth of the interaction of students' learning. Therefore, this study combines the construction of knowledge graphs and group cooperative learning to create a group knowledge graph learning tool based on a group to explore its influence on learners' knowledge ability level and interactive characteristics.","","978-1-7281-8473-9","10.1109/CSEI51395.2021.9477710","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9477710","group cooperative learning;knowledge graph;cooperation","Learning systems;Visualization;Computational modeling;Knowledge acquisition;Education;Knowledge based systems;Collaboration","","3","","12","IEEE","19 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is an active area of research since human thoughts can be collected, processed, and used in customer satisfaction, politics, and medical domains. Automated FER systems had been developed and have been used to recognize humans' emotions but it has been a quite challenging problem in machine learning due to the high intra-class variation. The first models were using known methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayes classifier, Fuzzy Techniques, Feature Selection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) in their models but still, some limitations affect the accuracy critically such as subjectivity, occlusion, pose, low resolution, scale, illumination variation, etc. The ability of CNN boosts FER accuracy. Deep learning algorithms have emerged as the greatest way to produce the best results in FER in recent years. Various datasets were used to train, test, and validate the models. FER2013, CK+, JAFFE and FERG are some of the most popular datasets. To improve the accuracy of FER models, one dataset or a mix of datasets has been employed. Every dataset includes limitations and issues that have an impact on the model that is trained for it. As a solution to this problem, our state-of-the-art model based on deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural network architectures (CNN) with supportive techniques has been implemented. The proposed model achieved 93.7% accuracy with the combination of FER2013 and CK+ datasets for FER2013.","","978-1-6654-7095-7","10.1109/ICECCME55909.2022.9988371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9988371","Convolutional neural network;emotion detection;deep learning;facial expression recognition","Support vector machines;Training;Deep learning;Emotion recognition;Mechatronics;Computational modeling;Face recognition","","2","","7","IEEE","30 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.","","978-1-6654-4875-8","10.1109/ISGTEurope52324.2021.9639956","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9639956","aging;distribution network;failure modeling;nonhomogeneous Poisson process;power cable","Analytical models;Power cables;Shape;Sensitivity analysis;Computational modeling;Loading;Power distribution","","","","16","IEEE","21 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The growing importance of “flipping the classroom” and the needful emphasizing of online-learning were owed to the situation. To meet these requirements, materials and tasks must be adapted. The Open Educational Resource (OER) textbook “Computational Thinking with the BBC micro:bit” was developed for the introduction of Computational Thinking (CT) for 10-14-year-old pupils in Austria's secondary schools. Example tasks in the textbook are designed with an open end and present extensions with ideas for further development instead of ending abruptly. This article provides a guideline for a clear distinction in redesigning existing lessons following the Inverted Classroom Model (ICM) using videos for pre-class work and live task extensions for in-class work. Which parts in the learning design must remain as live lessons and which parts can be adapted for video lessons? The respective research shows that examples that have a makerspace activity as an extension are especially helpful for an efficient determination of the appropriate part in the learning design and particularly suitable for an adaptation with ICM. The central advantage of the ICM is that it responds flexibly to the individual learning needs of each student. It allows students to take their time reviewing the material at their own pace without getting left behind. The textbook used here encourages pupils to find their own solutions by explorative learning using the block-based programming environment MakeCode. Additional information to be uncovered by the learner is provided for every single step in the accompanying online wiki website. Results from observations showed that this uncover-function, being a central element of the online material, encouraged the learners to explore their own way in finding a solution with playful elements and increased motivation. The many haptic elements of a makerspace activity are in particular useful for consolidation of the learned and are predisposed for in-class work and deepening the understanding following the constructionism theory. A Design-Based Research (DBR) approach is used to create and evaluate the redesign of a proven example task in a pilot project. Teachers, who are already familiar with the BBC micro:bit and the OER textbook, were trained on how to use the “flip-version” of an example task in their lessons and asked to develop a lesson plan for implementation. The didactic approach to redesigning the material and teacher training was evaluated during the first cycle of DBR. Results from expert interviews showed that the redesigned material and training deliver a solid ground for rework and further research on a larger scale.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637170","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637170","microbit;inverted classroom;flipped classroom;makerspace;block-based programming;computational thinking;computer science","Training;Adaptation models;Streaming media;Time measurement;Online services;Distributed Bragg reflectors;Task analysis","","1","","39","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Since then, data mining and artificial intelligence (AI) have become widespread and have been utilized in research and real world applications. We sometimes get consultations such as, “Please teach me about AI,” “I want to use deep learning in my business,” or “I want data mining to do a good job of analysis. What should researchers do? In response to these consultations, I will discuss three issues: 1) problems in which the data are available but cannot be used immediately (preprocessing issues), 2) problems in which the results are difficult to explain in an easy-to-understand manner (explainable AI), and 3) problems in which the purpose of data analysis has not been identified. First, I consider the topic “when we receive a consultation, there is a lot of data, but it is not ready for use.” This is a case in which the “data ready” stage identified by the researcher is different from the “data ready” stage identified by a general person. The second topic considers the following problem “the results presented by researchers are difficult for a general person to understand.” The researcher's explanations of the algorithm and its results are very difficult. A general person is unable to judge the data analysis result from the viewpoint of “is it useful for business?” The last topic is the most difficult; A general person vaguely thinks that “AI can do something,” but “something” does not allow researchers to identify issues.

The problems of understaffing of health care personnel compared to the WHO recommendation on the one hand, and the problems of poor distribution of these health care personnel over the extent of the health care system on the other hand, lead us to think about a model of mobility and accessibility of health care in Benin. This work aims at setting up an intelligent algorithm of accessibility and mobility of health care and will allow any patient embarked at any point of the health system to be taken care of automatically by a doctor and a nurse. To achieve this, we have (i) studied the state of the art of healthcare accessibility and mobility, (ii) modeled the healthcare trajectory, (iii) developed an algorithm for the automatic assignment and management of a patient in a healthcare system and simulated it using operations research and graph tools. The work allowed to set up a dynamic algorithm of accessibility to health care and to answer the challenges of the health care systems.","","978-1-6654-2567-4","10.1109/ICCMA53594.2021.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9565174","Accessibility;Mobility;Dynamic algorithm;embedded patient;Care trajectory","Operations research;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Medical services;Tools;Trajectory;Personnel","","","","20","IEEE","12 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we describe a novel first-year Software Engineering-First (SE-First) curriculum that introduces students to the broader picture of software development while students learn fundamental computing concepts. To assess the effectiveness of our novel first-year curriculum, we compare students who completed the first-year software engineering curriculum with students who completed our traditional computer science curriculum. We assess student knowledge of computing concepts, and their self-efficacy. Initial results show that students who complete the first-year software engineering courses perform as well or better on the computing concepts test, they are more confident in their computing abilities and in the application of computing skills to their field, and they have a higher success rate in their first-year computing courses (i.e., fewer students drop the course and fewer students receive a D or F course grade) compared with students who complete the traditional first-year computing program.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637325","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637325","software engineering;education;curriculum;software engineering-first model;computational thinking;attitudes;perceptions","Computer science;Codes;Computational modeling;Education;Writing;Market research;Software","","2","","14","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data, if used correctly, might be able to become a company's sharpest weapon in fighting the competition with other companies. Inventory cost is one of the most burdening costs in the food and beverage industry with the items like degradable raw materials or fresh ingredients. If not managed correctly might become a waste causing loss to the company. Degraded ingredients also might lower the overall food quality which might result in unsatisfied customers. Managing inventory, however, is not as easy as it seems, especially with the traditional method. This paper focuses on development of accurate predictive model using computational intelligence for optimal inventory management with a case study of restaurant ingredient management. Several machine learning algorithms like linear regression, multi-layer perceptron, random tree, random forest, and model trees were utilized to build accurate predictive models from time series data of the restaurant inventory. With good prediction system using computational intelligence, the inventory cost and wasted ingredients can be significantly reduced, which this eventually maximizes the profit.","","978-1-6654-4059-2","10.1109/ICTS52701.2021.9608492","Bina Nusantara University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9608492","machine learning algorithm;time series forecasting;inventory optimization and control","Waste reduction;Machine learning algorithms;Costs;Weapons;Companies;Predictive models;Inventory management","","2","","19","IEEE","23 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Later on, with the works of W. Ross Ashby, for example, biological concepts such as adaptation were interpreted in the light of cybernetic systems theory. Adaptation is the process by which a system is capable of regulating or controlling itself in order to adapt to changes of its inner and outer environment maintaining a homeostatic state. In earlier works we have developed a system metamodel that on the one hand refers to cybernetic concepts such as structure, operation, and system, and on the other to the philosophy of individuation of Gilbert Simondon. The result is the so-called allagmatic method that is capable of creating concrete models of systems such as artificial neural networks and cellular automata starting from abstract building blocks. In this paper, we add to our already existing method the cybernetic concepts of control and especially adaptation. In regard to the system metamodel, we rely again on philosophical theories, this time the philosophy of organism of Alfred N. Whitehead. We show how these new meta-theoretical concepts are described formally and how they are implemented in program code. We also show what role they play in simple experiments. We conclude that philosophical abstract concepts help to better understand the process of creating computer models and their control and adaptation. In the outlook we discuss how the allagmatic method needs to be extended in order to cover the field of complex systems and Norbert Wiener's ideas on control.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-8671-9","10.1109/IJCNN55064.2022.9892833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9892833","adaptation;control;complex systems modelling and simulation;cybernetics;meta-modelling;meta-programming;philosophy of individuation;philosophy of organism","Adaptation models;Philosophical considerations;Codes;Computational modeling;Process control;Control systems;Organisms","","3","","28","IEEE","30 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The 21st century we live in is a highly intelligent era. With the continuous emergence of intelligent computing as a typical technical means in contemporary network technology, the relationship between intelligent computing and people's life and work is getting closer and closer. However, college counselors are also facing many new problems and challenges. Therefore, how to improve the use of intelligent computing and better improve the competence of counselors has become a difficult problem for colleges and universities. Based on this, this article launched a research on the competency training ability of college counselors based on intelligent computing. This article uses behavioral incident interview method, literature analysis method and questionnaire survey method to carry out research. Through interviews with counselors, the competency characteristics of counselors are obtained, and the competency model of counselors is established. By consulting the literature, compiling questionnaires, designing a complete set of questionnaires in line with the research, and issuing questionnaires to 60% of college counselors and teachers to obtain the most authentic data. Collect relevant data through questionnaire surveys, and then enter the collected data into the database for data analysis. By consulting related materials, using publicly published papers and works at home and abroad as references, we can obtain basic theoretical support and background materials, as well as the current status and development level of the research on the competence of counselors. The survey results show that counselors have a strong understanding of work. Generally, 45% are familiar with them, 18% are relatively familiar, and few are very familiar. 40% of counselors think they have average competence. 44 % of counselors voluntarily signed up and wanted to participate in training to improve themselves. 51% of counselors believe that the best time for a training session is half a day. Regarding the training goals, only a small number of instructors have clear training goals. It can be seen that the research on the competence training ability of college counselors is of extremely high value.","","978-1-6654-2665-7","10.1109/CIPAE53742.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610480","Intelligent Computing;College Counselors;Competency Training;Questionnaire Survey","Training;Computers;Data analysis;Databases;Computational modeling;Force;Information processing","","","","10","IEEE","26 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these models also suffer from two pronounced challenges, that is, gigantic model size and prolonged turnaround time. To this end, we introduce E.T. that rE-thinks self-attention computation for Transformer models on GPUs with the following contributions: First, we introduce a novel self-attention architecture, which encompasses two tailored self-attention operators with corresponding sequence length-aware optimizations, and operation reordering optimizations. Second, we present an attention-aware pruning design which judiciously uses various pruning algorithms to reduce more computations hence achieves significantly shorter turnaround time. For the pruning algorithms, we not only revamp the existing pruning algorithms, but also tailor new ones for transformer models. Taken together, we evaluate E.T. across a variety of benchmarks for Transformer, BERTBASE and DistilBERT, where E.T. presents superior performance over the mainstream projects, including the popular Nvidia Enterprise solutions, i.e., TensorRT and FasterTransformer.","2167-4337","978-1-4503-8442-1","10.1145/3458817.3476138","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9910069","","Deep learning;Tensors;Computational modeling;High performance computing;Computer architecture;Benchmark testing;Transformers","","4","","63","","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons in SNNs are nondifferential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not biologically plausible. In this article, a biologically plausible reward propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1-D and 2-D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals from postsynaptic to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all prehidden layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be replaced with the spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think that the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspiration toward a better understanding of the biological system’s intelligent nature.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2021.3085966","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0104305); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61806195); Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB32070100,XDA27010404); Beijing Brain Science Project(grant numbers:Z181100001518006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9454259","Biologically plausible computing;neuronal dynamics;reward propagation;spiking neural network (SNN)","Neurons;Biology;Convolutional neural networks;Biological neural networks;Tuning;Membrane potentials;Neural networks","Neural Networks, Computer;Models, Neurological;Neurons;Algorithms;Reward","18","","73","IEEE","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous methods follow the common equally-spaced frame selection mechanism for appearance and motion modeling, which fails to consider redundant and distracting visual information. There is also no guarantee that all meaningful frames can be obtained. Moreover, this task needs to detect the location clues precisely from both spatial and temporal dimensions, but the relationship between spatial-temporal semantic information and query sentence is still unexplored in existing methods. Inspired by human thinking patterns, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine Spatial-Temporal Relationship Inference (CFSTRI) network to progressively localize fine-grained activity segments. Firstly, we present a coarse-grained crucial frame selection module, where the query-guided local difference context modeling from adjacent frames helps discriminate all the coarse boundary locations relevant to the sentence semantics, and the soft assignment vector of locally aggregated descriptors are employed to enhance the representation of selected frames. Then, we develop a fine-grained spatial-temporal relationship matching module to refine the coarse boundaries, which disentangles the spatial and temporal semantic information from query sentence to guide the excavation of visual grounding clues of corresponding dimensions. Furthermore, we devise a gated graph convolution network to incorporate the spatial-temporal semantic information by leveraging a gate operation to highlight frames referred to by the query sentence from spatial and temporal dimensions, and propagate fused information on the graph. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CFSTRI significantly outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095229","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61971128); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475486","Temporal sentence grounding;coarse-grained crucial frame selection;fine-grained spatial-temporal relationship matching;gated graph convolution network","Semantics;Grounding;Visualization;Task analysis;Logic gates;Proposals;Convolution","","1","","59","CCBY","6 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Python was selected to conduct the analysis because of its popularity and utility in the broader engineering field. Early exposure to this highly desired engineering skill can provide added benefits to students. Combining Python with an engaging lab experience can have a compounding effect on student learning outcomes. A five-week Python-based lab module was developed for an introductory thermal-fluid science class. The module reinforced fundamental concepts learned in lecture, while expanding on design-related analysis which is often left for advanced courses. The lab module began with an introduction to Python programming and quickly transitioned to the parametric analysis of standard Rankine, Gas Turbine, and Vapor Compression cycles. The lab module was designed to be self-guided with step-by-step instructions presented using Google Colab. This paper details the implementation and the student outcomes. Both direct and indirect assessments were conducted over two semesters of the course. Results indicate a strong positive impact on Python programming learning outcomes. Students acquired a working knowledge of Python programming and experienced how computational tools can be used to solve advanced engineering problems. At the same time, the student feedback indicated students' resistance to open-ended projects and independent learning; even if they are aware of their relevance and benefits to their future careers. Nevertheless, the positive learning outcomes were encouraging. Whether students pursue a career in thermodynamics or in a broader engineering field, this lab experience equipped them with tools that can augment their engineering skills.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962388","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962388","Thermodynamics;Python;Computational Thinking;Open-ended;Online Learning","Resistance;Knowledge engineering;Thermodynamics;Engineering profession;Internet;Problem-solving;Programming profession","","","","23","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) initiative called for a stronger connect with digital technology in formal educational settings in 2012. This was indeed much ahead of its time, as now evident from worldwide move towards digital education in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we tracked transformations within learning and teaching for over five years. At the inception of the idea, there was much resistance from parents and other stakeholders; however, the BYOD initiative ultimately showcased a very successful example of technology-supported teaching and learning initiative for other New Zealand schools. Our investigation primarily focused on one of the critical indicators for the success of such an initiative, the digital divide. The digital divide is particularly important because of the level of attention and dialogue this BYOD topic gathered across New Zealand. Initial discourses (over newspapers, radio and television) suggested that this initiative would be damaging in view of existing digital divides across societies and the overall public opinion outweighed the potential positives from such an initiative. As part of our five-year study, we investigated some of the key concerns around the digital divide issue in the context of such a technology-supported learning initiative. One of the key enablers of this study was integration of two frameworks, to enable the cross-examination of relationships between various sources of social cognitive abilities related to an individual’s information literacy, motivational and behavioral aspects. That is, how skill development, knowledge acquisition, and changes in personal and behavioral aspects impact self-efficacy levels as a consequence of BYOD strategies. The resulting framework is especially relevant in post-COVID-19 times, since technology-driven remote education delivery formats are now being touted as the new norm. Our framework will therefore provide much value to policy-makers in establishing inclusive educational policies.","","978-1-6654-9552-3","10.1109/CSDE53843.2021.9718393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9718393","BYOD;digital divide;three-level digital divide framework;socio-cultural framework for mobile learning","Resistance;TV;Tracking;Pandemics;Knowledge acquisition;Education;Data engineering","","","","26","IEEE","1 Mar 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Taking the clause as the basic semantic unit, the semantics were integrated by the local semantics of the clause itself and the global semantics of the cross clauses.

In our social design experiment approach, we designed and implemented a workshop where 14 racially- and ethnically-diverse youth crafted and coded interactive quilt patches that were digitally “stitched” into a collaborative artifact, with each patch reimagining CS from youths' perspectives (particularly regarding what CS is, who can participate in CS, and how CS is done). By analyzing post-workshop interviews and participant artifacts, we observed that counterstorytelling through electronic quilting can act as accessible and authentic tools to support youth's political identity work, electronic counternarrative expression, and community building in computing education.

However, most existing works are dedicated to improve the prediction accuracy through either creating new model architectures, increasing model complexity, or refining model parameters by training on larger datasets. Here, we propose an alternative idea, differing from existing work, to increase model accuracy and also to shape model predictions to align with human understandings through automatically creating higher-level summarizing labels for similar groups of human activities. First, we argue the importance and feasibility of constructing a hierarchical labeling system for human activity recognition. Then, we utilize the predictions of a black box HAR model to identify similarities between different activities. Finally, we tailor hierarchical clustering methods to automatically generate hierarchical trees of activities and conduct experiments. In this system, the activity labels on the same level will have a designed magnitude of accuracy and reflect a specific amount of activity details. This strategy enables a trade-off between the extent of the details in the recognized activity and the user privacy by masking some sensitive predictions; and also provides possibilities for the use of formerly prohibited invasive models in privacy-concerned scenarios. Since the hierarchy is generated from the machine's perspective, the predictions at the upper levels provide better accuracy, which is especially useful when there are too detailed labels in the training set that are rather trivial to the final prediction goal. Moreover, the analysis of the structure of these trees can reveal the biases in the prediction model and guide future data collection strategies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3053084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328751","Hierarchical labeling;human activity recognition;machine learning;privacy preservation;video processing","Predictive models;Privacy;Taxonomy;Computational modeling;Labeling;Data models;Activity recognition","","1","","30","CCBY","20 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the purpose of providing practical insights for the design of blended programming lessons, this study introduced an instructional unit of a K-12 programming course in a secondary school in China. It elaborated the course regarding lesson design, learning assessment, and course evaluation. The course contains 9 plugged sessions and 24 unplugged sessions, and each session consists of 1) a preview, 2) hands-on activities, and 3) a lesson summary. Student learning was evaluated with performance-based assessments, and a questionnaire was employed to collect students’ feedback for the course. The results indicated that students with low performance were the benefit the most from the course, and students tended to like visual programming tool and stage-mode learning format. Also, students with different learning backgrounds showed different preferences for the instructional elements.

One such Either-Or binary that is relevant to our project so far is computing vs. computational thinking.2 A keynote address delivered recently at a computing education conference by the computer scientist and educator Judy Robertson is quite illuminating in this respect.3 Robertson argued against a blind emphasis on computational “thinking” as the centerpiece of computational literacy. Focusing only on creating SCRATCH programs may lead especially young learners away from understanding how the computer actually works as a “machine.” Children's drawings of what is inside a computer show that learning to use computational abstractions that we typically introduce in the K-12 levels—such as variables and loops—does not necessarily help us understand how these abstractions are processed and represented inside the computer. What gets lost in our push to teach children how to code is the physicality of computing as a machine, which involves a deeper understanding of the relationship between the hardware and software—and many other forms of computational abstractions that are not even presented to children as part of their experience of coding or computing.","","9780262363075","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9388156.pdf&bkn=9382289&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","29 Mar 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

For this task, the approach that consists of independently mapping text and vision to a joint embedding space, a.k.a. dual encoders, is attractive as retrieval scales and is efficient for billions of images using approximate nearest neighbour search. An alternative approach of using vision-text transformers with cross-attention gives considerable improvements in accuracy over the joint embeddings, but is often inapplicable in practice for large-scale retrieval given the cost of the cross-attention mechanisms required for each sample at test time. This work combines the best of both worlds. We make the following three contributions. First, we equip transformer-based models with a new fine-grained cross-attention architecture, providing significant improvements in retrieval accuracy whilst preserving scalability. Second, we introduce a generic approach for combining a Fast dual encoder model with our Slow but accurate transformer-based model via distillation and reranking. Finally, we validate our approach on the Flickr30K image dataset where we show an increase in inference speed by several orders of magnitude while having results competitive to the state of the art.

Classical BO methods assume that the objective function is a black box. However, internal information about objective function computation is often available. For example, when optimizing a manufacturing line's throughput with simulation, we observe the number of parts waiting at each workstation, in addition to the overall throughput. Recent BO methods leverage such internal information to dramatically improve performance. We call these “grey-box” BO methods because they treat objective computation as partially observable and even modifiable, blending the black-box approach with so-called “white-box” first-principles knowledge of objective function computation. This tutorial describes these methods, focusing on BO of composite objective functions, where one can observe and selectively evaluate individual constituents that feed into the overall objective; and multi-fidelity BO, where one can evaluate cheaper approximations of the objective function by varying parameters of the evaluation oracle.","1558-4305","978-1-6654-3311-2","10.1109/WSC52266.2021.9715343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9715343","","Computational modeling;Focusing;Tutorials;Linear programming;Throughput;Bayes methods;Workstations","","12","","64","IEEE","23 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While most work focuses on end-to-end evaluations of such models, it often remains unclear what the models actually learn, and to what extent their reasoning about code matches that of skilled humans. A poor understanding of the model reasoning risks deploying models that are right for the wrong reason, and taking decisions based on spurious correlations in the training dataset. This paper investigates to what extent the attention weights of effective neural models match the reasoning of skilled humans. To this end, we present a methodology for recording human attention and use it to gather 1,508 human attention maps from 91 participants, which is the largest such dataset we are aware of. Computing human-model correlations shows that the copy attention of neural models often matches the way humans reason about code (Spearman rank coefficients of 0.49 and 0.47), which gives an empirical justification for the intuition behind copy attention. In contrast, the regular attention of models is mostly uncorrelated with human attention. We find that models and humans sometimes focus on different kinds of tokens, e.g., strings are important to humans but mostly ignored by models. The results also show that human-model agreement positively correlates with accurate predictions by a model, which calls for neural models that even more closely mimic human reasoning. Beyond the insights from our study, we envision the release of our dataset of human attention maps to help understand future neural models of code and to foster work on human-inspired models.","2643-1572","978-1-6654-0337-5","10.1109/ASE51524.2021.9678712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9678712","Artificial intelligence for software engineering;Empirical software engineering;Program comprehension;Software analysis","Training;Codes;Correlation;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Syntactics;Cognition","","8","","67","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the classification process is time consuming and requires experience. Many studies have attempted to automate the process by utilizing different machine learning and text mining approaches, but none has examined the classification of Arabic questions. The purpose of this study is to examine this research gap and to introduce a new feature extraction method that would better suit Arabic questions and their unique characteristics. It also aims to provide Arab instructors with a tool that can help them automatically classify their assessment questions. To accomplish this purpose, the study developed a dataset of more than 600 Arabic assessment questions. It then proposed a modified term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) method for extracting features from Arabic questions. Unlike the traditional TF-IDF, the proposed method was designed to take the nature of assessment questions into consideration. It was evaluated by comparing it to two methods that have been used for classifying English questions, i.e., the traditional TF-IDF and a modified TF-IDF method called term frequency part-of-speech-inverse document frequency (TFPOS-IDF). A t-test was utilized to examine whether the difference in performance between the three methods was statistically significant. The proposed method outperformed the two other methods. The overall accuracy, precision, and recall scored by the proposed method were significantly higher than those scored by the traditional TF-IDF and TFPOS-IDF methods. The evaluation results indicate the promising potential of the proposed method, which can be extended to other languages.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3094115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9469876","Arabic text classification;feature extraction;learning analytics;machine learning;TF-IDF","Feature extraction;Taxonomy;Machine learning;Text mining;Classification algorithms;Text categorization;Task analysis","","20","","61","CCBY","1 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Access to higher education remains a challenge for many families. The emergence of Industry 4.0 will not only affect technological changes but also people in the labour market. As such, higher education institutions with academic responsibilities of formally training students to better adapt to such changes are not left out. Since the introduction of the Master of Business Administration (MBA) in the United States of America in 1908 and over one hundred years of history, this prestigious programme has suffered a rapid decline in enrolments worldwide. Thus, it has gradually lost its value under the current industrial revolution. This paper evaluates and prioritizes barriers affecting the decline in international MBA enrolments. Understanding the key barriers to MBA enrolments regarding the dynamics will contribute to the successful implementation of those barriers. With scarce information, this study innovatively applies the grey incidence analysis (GIA) method to prioritizing the identified barriers. When applied, this method provided a robust prediction of results. For international MBA enrolments decline, the barrier “employment difficulties” (H3) should receive much attention from policymakers because it scored the highest among the barriers ranked. Further, other important barriers that should be considered are “lack of entrepreneurship skills” (H11), “high cost” (H10), “longer payback duration” (H1), “10 yr. ROI” (H9), and “lack of data analytic skills” (H7). Therefore, during the formulation and implementation of policy to address these prioritized barriers, scarce resources must be committed to them.

The proposed network utilizes a novel hybrid architecture consisting of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP). The LSTM block takes a sequence of coefficients representing the morphology of ECG beats while the MLP input layer is fed with features derived from instantaneous heart rate. Simultaneous training of the blocks pushes the overall network to learn distinct features complementing each other for making decisions. The network was evaluated in terms of accuracy, computational complexity, and power consumption using data from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database. To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we augmented the dataset using SMOTE algorithm for network training. The network achieved an average classification accuracy of 97% across several records in the database. Further, the network was mapped to a fixed point model, retrained in a bit accurate fixed-point environment to compensate for the quantization error, and ported to an ARM Cortex M4 based embedded platform. In laboratory testing, the overall system was successfully demonstrated, and a significant saving of $\simeq \!\! 50\%$ power was achieved by gating the wireless transmission using the classifier. Wireless transmission was enabled only to transmit the beats deemed anomalous by the classifier. The proposed technique compares favourably with current methods in terms of computational complexity and has the advantage of stand-alone operation in the edge node, without the need for always-on wireless connectivity making it ideal for IoT wearable devices.","1940-9990","","10.1109/TBCAS.2021.3137646","Microelectronic Circuit Centre Ireland(grant numbers:MCCI-2018-03); Irish Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9669005","Anomaly detection;edge computing;IoT sensors;LSTM;MLP;neural networks;power reduction","Electrocardiography;Feature extraction;Wireless sensor networks;Training;Databases;Wireless communication;Power demand","Algorithms;Arrhythmias, Cardiac;Electrocardiography;Heart Rate;Humans;Neural Networks, Computer","57","","36","CCBY","4 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The chapter describes antenna operation, and inter‐antenna coupling, in the way a full‐wave computational electromagnetics (CEM) model “thinks” about it. The rigorous formulations on which full‐wave CEM models are based argue as follows: the field generated by the impressed sources if all of the antenna structure were to be removed is the incident field and exists in all of space.

Based on principles of explainability for co-creative systems from previous literature, we propose a framework of explainability specifically applied to mixed-initiative scenarios in game design.

The use of computing software has become ubiquitous and a working knowledge of data science has become increasingly essential for researchers in all domains. However, curriculum development focusing on imparting foundational programming skills and fundamentals of data science for researchers in domains other than computing has been scarce. Thus, there is an unmet need for curriculum development involving computational thinking, programming, and the fundamentals of data science for this audience. Recognizing these growing needs and demands of researchers to learn programming and data science that can then be applied to their area of research or practice, we developed an introductory course in programming and data science for PDRs in biology and medicine. The primary goal of the course was to develop computational thinking skills in PDRs who hail from backgrounds that have traditionally not focused on inculcating computational thinking. This course covered the fundamental concepts of programming using either Python or R - languages that researchers outside the computing community use in numerous ways including the statistical analysis of large datasets that are becoming increasingly common in biomedical research. Further, PDRs enrolled in the course were introduced to some of the broad categories of problems in data science - exploratory data analysis, classification, regression, and clustering - along with relevant algorithms and how they can be applied to real-world datasets in their respective domains using packages or libraries in Python or R. We also report the feedback from the enrolled PDRs, lessons learned, and recommendations for instructors interested in designing similar curricula. Our course focusing on computing and data science education for postdoctoral scholars from a non-computing background demonstrates a promising model for incorporating computing education in other areas of study that do not traditionally have a focus on computing education as well as in continuing education.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962737","computer science education;interdisciplinary computing education;data science education;continuing education","Statistical analysis;Education;Curriculum development;Focusing;Data science;Software;Libraries","","","","29","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advancement of technology has led to e-learning in education. E-learning refers to online learning, which provides students with a virtual environment in which students engage in several activities. However, even with the increasingly utilise of e-learning platform, research has proven that the issues of students were not fully utilise the functions of e-learning platforms in their learning process still exist. It is just act as a supporting tool for them and lack of communication support provided by learning management system (LMS) has leads to using other platform for communication purposes. Pervasive tools in education such as mobile devices, wearable technology, and RFID has proven to have positive impact on student learning outcome, however its application in higher education settings is still relatively little. Hence with the limitations of current teaching practice with limitations of study focusing on utilizing pervasive tools, therefore the aim of this study is to investigate the important factors which affect the user behaviour of IT devices (pervasive tools). To achieve this, theories of technology acceptance model (TAM) and task technology fit (TTF) was used. Along with TAM and TTF characteristics, factors of enjoyment, usefulness, convenience, compatibility, social influence, computer self-efficacy, and mobility were also considered. This study provides a framework to better understand the factors affect the acceptance of pervasive tools in private universities in Malaysia.","","978-1-7281-7153-1","10.1109/ICCOINS49721.2021.9497216","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497216","21st century learners;e-learning;pervasive tools;technology acceptance model;task technology fit","Electronic learning;Technology acceptance model;Computational modeling;Education;Virtual environments;Tools;Mobile handsets","","8","","43","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The law and the statistical significance of the relationship are validated by applying them to the high-quality dblp data set. The model allows to predict the number of publications for research groups, and its effectiveness is tested on the data set by fine fittings on the distribution of the number of publications for researchers, the evolutionary trend of their publication productivity, and the probability of producing publications.

The aim of this work is to call the attention of computing educators to an approach that uses 3D virtual environments to teaching programming. We introduce this approach through a tool that offers innovative methods for teaching wide spectrum of computing topics; Alice. Alice is an innovative programming environment that can be used to create stories by animating characters in a 3D world. Alice is written in Java and has an object-oriented flavor.

The data has been recorded via a smartphone app over a two-week ecological momentary assessment with three recording sessions per day. Each session's speech samples are accompanied by a self-assessed rating on the discrete visual analogue mood scale (VAMS) from 0-10. As these ratings are highly subjective, a personalised machine learning method is leveraged. For this purpose, the beginning of the recording period is utilised to train both a shared model backbone, and adapt personalised layers added at the end to each speaker's speech. Our approach yields a Spearman's correlation coefficient (p) of 0.79 on the test set, compared to the non-personalised baseline of p=0.61. Furthermore, we analyse our results with regard to the type of speech sample - reading three depression-related questions, answering them, and freely formulating an uplifting spontaneous thought. Here, we find that personalisation boosts performance across all types, especially for the fixed content question readings. Overall, our work highlights the efficacy of personalised machine learning for depressed mood monitoring.","2575-5145","978-1-6654-8557-9","10.1109/EHB55594.2022.9991737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9991737","computational paralinguistics;digital health;depression;personalisation","Deep learning;Emotion recognition;Visualization;Mood;Biological system modeling;Speech recognition;Depression","","2","","29","IEEE","2 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research area typically implies a high computational burden and thus, requires high scalability as well as availability to ensure no data loss or waist of computational power. Moreover, the thinking of developing applications has changed from monolithic once to microservices. Hence, we developed a highly scalable and available multi-objective neural architecture search and adopted to the modern thinking of developing application by subdividing an already existing, monolithic neural architecture search - based on a genetic algorithm - into microservices. Furthermore, we adopted the initial population creation by 1,000 mutations of each individual, extended the approach by inception layers, implemented it as island model to facilitate scalability and achieved on MNIST, Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset 99.75%, 94.35% and 89.90% test accuracy respectively. Besides, our model is strongly focused on high availability empowered by the deployment in our bare-metal Kubernetes cluster.

The brain shrinks and loses brain cells as a result of Alzheimer's disease. While the condition can strike at any age, most patients with Alzheimer's disease are over 65.. Alzheimer patients mostly have Symptoms like memory loss, disorientation and problems with thinking ability but vary from person to person. Although genetics, environment, and lifestyle are the most likely causes of this illness, other experts think there may be multiple causes. The term “dementia” refers to brain illnesses that impair thinking, memory, and behaviour. The most typical cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease typically struggle to speak clearly, identify relatives and friends, and recognise items. They can also become angry, restless, and frustrated. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, physical issues like weakness, loss of balance, and impaired bladder and bowel control appear. In this study paper, we will introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is a machine learning technique, to recognise Alzheimer's disease. On the input image, image segmentation is carried out. CNN is a group of artificial neural networks that provides a more scalable approach to image classification and identification of patterns in images. Convolution is a mathematical procedure that CNN employs in place of matrix multiplication at one layer. CNN are different from other neural networks by their exceptional performance with audio, image or speech signal inputs. CNN algorithm take an input image, assign priority to different aspects for an image to find difference between images. CNN Captures Spatial and Temporal dependencies of an image using application of relevant filters.","","978-1-6654-7655-3","10.1109/ICCST55948.2022.10040358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040358","Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network;Alzheimer's disease (AD)","Image segmentation;Scientific computing;Machine learning;Genetics;Convolutional neural networks;Medical diagnosis;Alzheimer's disease","","2","","15","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Work design identifies tasks, activities, relationships, and responsibilities in a specific job. It provides a comprehensive job description useful for examining and creating optimal working conditions, also by developing empowering workers or by restructuring their responsibilities. Human-robot interaction is among the domains with a high demand for work design. It is related to the widespread human fear of being replaced by machines at work, as well as the still small number of publications in this field, mostly devoted to human-robot interaction analysis conditions. Scholars have identified an elaborated set of tasks by a human during working with a robot. From work design perspective, besides expanding what tasks are considered, it is crucial to consider its meaning for creating critical psychological states, which are important for individual and organisational results. Thus, the paper preparation’s impetus describes and analyses the tasks carried out by robot operators in a more precise manner, by using psychological work analysis from the work design perspective. The research group consists of 32 robot operators from a large international manufacturing company. The Work Design Questionnaire (WDQ) by Morgeson and Humphrey (2006) was used to describe 21 of work characteristics. Results show that Task Variety, Information Processing, Task Identity, Specialisation, Skill Variety, Problem-solving, Task Significance, Received Interdependence, Feedback From Others, and Feedback from Job are the highest work characteristics of robot operators. It suggests that robot operators distinguish non-routine, cognitive, and interpersonal tasks as more substantial than other tasks. Alike, according to the work design theory, the work characteristics indicated by respondents are recognised as important job-specific factors for workers’ critical psychological states i.e., experiencing meaning, feeling responsible for outcomes, and understanding the results of their efforts, and helping shape the context of the work. It is imperative that further and more extensive research is conducted to bring more attention to how work design can support individuals’ cognitive, social, and identity development in human-robot interaction.","2379-1675","978-1-7281-7698-7","10.1109/CogSIMA51574.2021.9475924","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475924","task-based approach;Work Design;work characteristics;human-robot interaction","Employee welfare;Shape;Service robots;Psychology;Human-robot interaction;Information processing;Manufacturing","","3","","36","IEEE","9 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

People of Arabic Peninsula are all about representing the beauty of their Islamic culture in unique contemporary ways that would astonish the world. Arabic calligraphy is one of such sources. The distinctive geometric shapes and forms of different character types and styles like Kufi, Naskh, Diwani, Thuluth etc., gives designers the opportunity to design and develop exquisite pieces of art in both interior design and architectural field. The design elements of modern interior design act as a guiding principle infusing this art form in design. Modern Arab interior and architectural designs are incredibly unique yet sophisticated and luxurious. The usage of calligraphy in design can prove to be a substantial method of portraying history and culture expressed through the character of letters to be used in furniture, columns, ceiling, architectural buildings etc. This paper shows how Arabic calligraphy is not limited to just traditional decorative purposes but can have much wider application at both macro and micro level in modern world of design. It is a great source of inspiration for designers attempting to integrate the art of calligraphy in design of modern furniture as well as architectural structures. The paper demonstrates how designers like Zaha Hadid, and many others borrowed this traditional art form, infused it with modern touch and took it to new heights of contemporary design through their modernized lenses and vision.

Computational method is more suitable for large-scale experiment than biological experimental method due to time and expense, and it can provide reference and basis for biological experiment. Nonetheless, developing computational method to predict function of a newly detected lncRNA is still a challenging task. Some lncRNAs work according to binding with proteins, so calculating interaction preferences of lncRNA-protein may provide novel breakthrough to develop new computational approaches. In this work, we propose a novel lncRNA function prediction method to link function of lncRNAs and RNA binding protein. The method consists of two steps: firstly, we improve the CNN models of DLPRB, a high-performance deep neural network for protein-RNA binding preferences prediction, secondly, we apply a voting algorithm to predict lncRNA function by integrating binding preference predicting models. As we know, it is the first time that using RNA-protein preferences to predict function of lncRNAs. We test the predicting approach with 25 lncRNAs from LncBook, and the results confirm our approach makes sense. The approach only uses sequence-based features, so it can be a novel choice for newly detected lncRNA function prediction.

The proposed model enables the fusion of multiresolution sensor data, without having to resort to padding/ resampling to correct for frequency resolution differences even when carrying out temporal inferences like high-resolution event detection. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated for sleep apnea event detection, by fusing three different sensor signals obtained from UCD St. Vincent University Hospital’s sleep apnea database. The proposed model is generalizable and this is demonstrated by incremental performance improvements, proportional to the number of sensors used for fusion. A selective dropout technique is used to prevent overfitting of the model to any specific high-resolution input, and increase the robustness of fusion to signal corruption from any sensor source. A fusion model with electrocardiogram (ECG), Peripheral oxygen saturation signal (SpO2), and abdominal movement signal achieved an accuracy of 99.72% and a sensitivity of 98.98%.

Using data from 208 sessions and 948 players of a tabletop game run in the wild by a major national organization over 16 months, we explore how choices are affected by player background (e.g., cyber security experts versus risk analysts, board-level decision makers versus technical experts) and different team make-ups (homogeneous teams of security experts versus various mixes). We find that no group of experts makes significantly better game decisions than anyone else, and that their biases lead them to not fully comprehend what they are defending or how the defenses work.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2020.3023735","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(grant numbers:EP/M002780/1); DYPOSIT(grant numbers:EP/N021657/2); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9195777","Social and professional topics~computational thinking;applied computing~enterprise computing infrastructures","Games;Stakeholders;Computer security;Decision making;Organizations;Investment","","7","","48","IEEE","14 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

School outings have also suffered from the limited mobility of students given by stay-at-home orders and other restrictions. In this paper we present a set of technologies developed to reproduce the school trip experience, allowing students to stay at home or in school and requiring only a Web browser and Internet access, while integrating communication tools that allow participants to actively be engaged in interactive lessons and educational experiences. In 2020 the tool has been used during the “CodyTrip” event, a two-day visit to the town of Urbino, attended by more than 15.000 students, followed up with a series of events in 2021 with over 115.000 participants. Results from the pilot events show very high engagement and demonstrate the feasibility of organizing online visiting experiences with massive participation without compromising the perceived interactivity of the proposed activities, which can be equally engaging for different audience demographics.

Nevertheless, debugging poses a major hurdle in the K12 classroom, as students are often rather helpless and rely on the teacher hurrying from one student-PC to the other. Despite this, debugging is an underrepresented topic in the classroom as well as in computer science education research, as only few studies, materials and concepts discuss the explicit teaching of debugging. According to the constructivist learning theory, teaching and developing concepts and materials for the classroom have to take learners' preexisting experience into account. Students' preexisting debugging experience is built through troubleshooting, where they frequently find and fix errors in their daily lives - before they learn to program - for example when repairing their bicycle or if “the internet” stops working. Debugging is a special case of general troubleshooting and shares common characteristics, such as the overall process or particular strategies. Thus, the aim of this study is to develop an instrument for assessing preexisting debugging experience in the form of a real-world escape room consisting of debugging-related troubleshooting tasks. This allows us to observe students' troubleshooting process, strategies, and overall behavior in a natural environment and thus assess preexisting debugging experience. To this end, a design-based research process was conducted and a real-world escape room consisting of various troubleshooting tasks was developed. Those tasks and the escape room setting provide an innovative methodological approach to study students troubleshooting behavior and assess their preexisting debugging experience.","2165-9567","978-1-7281-8478-4","10.1109/EDUCON46332.2021.9453972","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453972","debugging;troubleshooting;escape room;computer science education;K12;computational thinking","Systematics;Instruments;Conferences;Debugging;Bicycles;Computer science education;Task analysis","","1","","47","IEEE","18 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In Part I, we examine continuities between the turn-of-the-twentieth-century discussions of poznaniye—an epistemic orientation towards the process of knowledge acquisition—and the postwar rise of the Soviet school of mathematical logic. Establishing this connection allows us to explain, in Part II, the role of the algorithm in disciplinary dynamics between mathematical logic and cybernetics and a characteristic understanding of programming, not as a narrow skill, but as a matter of consciousness.","1934-1547","","10.1109/MAHC.2021.3135714","Universit degli Studi di Padova(grant numbers:SID2018 project "Analysis of STatic Analyses (ASTA); Ministero dellIstruzione dellUniversit e della Ricerca(grant numbers:PRIN 2017 no. 201784YSZ5 "Analysis of Program Anal); Facebook(grant numbers:2020 Probability and Programming Research Award); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9670655","","Cybernetics;Programming profession;Dynamic programming;Mathematics;Heuristic algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Cognition","","1","","64","IEEE","5 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Researchers have developed various generative models capable of imitating musical conventions, comprehending the musical corpora, and generating new samples based on the learning outcome. Although the samples generated by these models are persuasive, they often lack musical structure and creativity. For instance, a vanilla end-to-end approach, which deals with all levels of music representation at once, does not offer human-level control and interaction during the learning process, leading to constrained results. Indeed, music creation is a recurrent process that follows some principles by a musician, where various musical features are reused or adapted. On the other hand, a musical piece adheres to a musical style, breaking down into precise concepts of timbre style, performance style, composition style, and the coherency between these aspects. Here, we study and analyze the current advances in music generation using deep learning models through different criteria. We discuss the shortcomings and limitations of these models regarding interactivity and adaptability.

The design of such an integrated system is a complex multiphysics problem given the high number of variables to identify, objectives to optimize, and constraints to satisfy. Traditionally, this complex problem is approached subdividing the design in different steps, where in each step, the single components are designed and optimized independently from the others. This might clearly overlook the effect that the design choices of a single subsystem has on other subsystems, leading to suboptimal solutions. In this article, an automated design approach is proposed with the aim of maximizing power density whilst minimizing total losses. As a vessel to investigate the presented optimization workflow, the magnetically coupled interleaved H-bridge topology is chosen as an emblematic example of multivariable design problem. The first step of this approach consists of developing a loss model of the converter, which takes into account components physical dimensions, the temperature dependence, and the circuit parasitics. In the second step, these models are used within a nested optimization procedure in order to estimate the losses for multiple points of load. With the aim of validating both design approach and optimization results, three different optimal solutions have been deeply analyzed with commercial suit, prototyped, and tested.

Because the gene expression data extraction experiment has the characteristics of a large number of genes and complex and changeable experimental conditions, clustering technology has been introduced into the field of molecular biology to assist research and analyze gene expression data. Currently, many clustering algorithms are applied in gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, owing to the high dimensionality of gene expression data, many algorithms face the problem of low computational efficiency. The method based on the graph theory thinks of the sample of gene expression data as the point in high-dimensional space. Its low sample performance determines that the constructed matrix is small in size. Therefore, it has lower computational complexity. Therefore, the graph regularized non-negative matrices factorization (GNMF) proposed by Cai et al. has been widely used for gene clustering. However, the deficiency of the GNMF algorithm is unstable with data variation for gene clustering. In this paper, we propose post-processing of Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization Algorithm for Gene Clustering, called pGNMF. In the pGNMF method, we first normalize the solution of GNMF, thereby reducing the sensitivity of the traditional GNMF method to the prior selection of genes or initial conditions, and effectively improving the robustness of the algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing GNMF algorithms for gene clustering.","","978-1-6654-5482-7","10.1109/IMASBD57215.2022.00021","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10143578","Post-processing;GNMF;Gene clustering;Robust","Sensitivity;Clustering algorithms;Oncology;Robustness;Sensors;Manufacturing;Gene expression","","","","21","IEEE","6 Jun 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The IoT and, by virtue, the IIoT, are vulnerable to new types of threats and intrusions because of the nature of their networks. So it is crucial to develop Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that can provide the security, privacy, and integrity of IIoT networks. In this research, we propose an IDS for IIoT that was implemented using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) for feature selection, and the Random Forest (RF) model was employed in the GA fitness function. The models used for the intrusion detection processes include classifiers such as the RF, Linear Regression (LR), Naïve Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Extra-Trees (ET), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB). The GA-RF generated 10 feature vectors for the binary classification scheme and 7 feature vectors for the multiclass classification procedure. The UNSW-NB15 is used to assess the effectiveness and the robustness of our proposed approach. The experimental outcomes demonstrated that for the binary modeling process, the GA-RF achieved a test accuracy (TAC) of 87.61% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, using a feature vector that contained 16 features. These results were superior to existing IDS frameworks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9511416","Internet of Things;intrusion detection;genetic algorithm;machine learning","Industrial Internet of Things;Feature extraction;Intrusion detection;Genetic algorithms;Radio frequency;Support vector machines;Random forests","","73","","54","CCBY","11 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A number of studies using the Brainbit brain-computer were carried out as a part of various activities, including the performance of tasks with the Expert air traffic controller simulator. Findings from computational processing of electroencephalography signals revealed the degree of synchronization of brain hemispheres depending on the complexity of the tasks. We propose to use a ratio of mean values of direct and inverse correlation across short epochs as a synchronization (coordination) factor for the activities of both hemispheres. We were able to identify regularities behind the change of the coordination factor depending on the complexity of the task and the degree of involvement in its performance. Three levels of task complexity (high, medium and low) were identified. The coordination factor will vary depending on the complexity level of a particular task. We were able to determine that a high involvement in the performance of a medium-complexity task is accompanied by a high level of coordination.

Through evolutionary surrogate-assisted prescription, it is possible to generate a large number of candidate strategies and evaluate them with predictive models. In principle, strategies can be customized for different countries and locales, and balance the need to contain the pandemic and the need to minimize their economic impact. Early experiments suggest that workplace and school restrictions are the most important and need to be designed carefully. They also demonstrate that results of lifting restrictions can be unreliable, and suggest creative ways in which restrictions can be implemented softly, e.g., by alternating them over time.

However, far less attention has been paid to the inverse task: instruction generation - learning a speaker to generate grounded descriptions for navigation routes. Existing VLN methods train a speaker independently and often treat it as a data augmentation tool to strengthen the follower, while ignoring rich cross-task relations. Here we describe an approach that learns the two tasks simultaneously and exploits their intrinsic correlations to boost the training of each: the follower judges whether the speaker-created instruction explains the original navigation route correctly, and vice versa. Without the need of aligned instruction-path pairs, such cycle-consistent learning scheme is complementary to task-specific training targets defined on labeled data, and can also be applied over unlabeled paths (sampled without paired instructions). Another agent, called creator is added to generate counterfactual environments. It greatly changes current scenes yet leaves novel items - which are vital for the execution of original instructions - unchanged. Thus more informative training scenes are synthesized and the three agents compose a powerful VLN learning system. Extensive experiments on a standard benchmark show that our approach improves the performance of various follower models and produces accurate navigation instructions.","2575-7075","978-1-6654-6946-3","10.1109/CVPR52688.2022.01503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9879110","Vision + language","Training;Learning systems;Computer vision;Correlation;Navigation;Computational modeling;Buildings","","21","","91","IEEE","27 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brute-force fault simulation for determining fault criticality is computationally expensive due to many potential fault sites in the accelerator array and the dependence of criticality characterization of PEs on the functional input data. Supervised learning techniques can be used to accurately estimate fault criticality but it requires ground truth for model training. The ground-truth collection involves extensive and computationally expensive fault simulations. We present a framework for analyzing fault criticality with a negligible amount of ground-truth data. We incorporate the gate-level structural and functional information of the PEs in their ""neural twins"", referred to as ""PE-Nets"". The PE netlist is translated into a trainable PE-Net, where the standard-cell instances are substituted by their corresponding ""Cell-Nets"" and the wires translate to neural connections. Each Cell-Net is a pre-trained DNN that models the Boolean-logic behavior of the corresponding standard cell. In the PE-Net, every neural connection is associated with a bias that represents a perturbation in the signal propagated by that connection. We utilize a recently proposed misclassification-driven training algorithm to sensitize and identify biases that are critical to the functioning of the accelerator for a given application workload. The proposed framework achieves up to 100% accuracy in fault-criticality classification in 16-bit and 32-bit PEs by using the criticality knowledge of only 2% of the total faults in a PE.","2378-2250","978-1-6654-1695-5","10.1109/ITC50571.2021.00015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9611337","","Training;Computational modeling;Perturbation methods;Wires;Supervised learning;AI accelerators;Systolic arrays","","14","","24","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ACE is crucial for maintaining the safety of the rover, but is computationally expensive. If the most promising candidates in the list of paths are all found to be infeasible, ENav must continue to search the list and run time-consuming ACE evaluations until a feasible path is found. In this paper, we present two heuristics that, given a terrain heightmap around the rover, produce cost estimates that more effectively rank the candidate paths before ACE evaluation. The first heuristic uses Sobel operators and convolution to incorporate the cost of traversing high-gradient terrain. The second heuristic uses a machine learning (ML) model to predict areas that will be deemed untraversable by ACE. We used physics simulations to collect training data for the ML model and to run Monte Carlo trials to quantify navigation performance across a variety of terrains with various slopes and rock distributions. Compared to ENav's baseline performance, integrating the heuristics can lead to a significant reduction in ACE evaluations and average computation time per planning cycle, increase path efficiency, and maintain or improve the rate of successful traverses. This strategy of targeting specific bottlenecks with ML while maintaining the original ACE safety checks provides an example of how ML can be infused into planetary science missions and other safety-critical software.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-7436-5","10.1109/AERO50100.2021.9438337","Jet Propulsion Laboratory; California Institute of Technology; National Aeronautics and Space Administration(grant numbers:80NM0018D0004); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9438337","","Navigation;Computational modeling;Software algorithms;Training data;Machine learning;Software;Inference algorithms","","11","","17","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Findings from the analysis of survey and interview data indicate that serving as a near-peer mentor reinforced mentors' prior programming knowledge, increased their programming self-efficacy beliefs, and prompted self-reflection on the purpose of mentoring relationships. In addition to these benefits, the results also revealed the need to provide mentors with continued opportunities to build mentoring competencies and practice culturally responsive teaching strategies.

Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2021.3114866","DFG(grant numbers:389792660); DFG as part of the Germany's Excellence Strategy EXC 2050/1(grant numbers:390696704); Cluster of Excellence “Centre for Tactile Internet” (CeTI) of TU Dresden; European Research Council(grant numbers:683300); German Israeli Foundation(grant numbers:1-1513-407./2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9552899","Analyzing Counterexamples;Hyperproperties;Multiple Coordinate Views;Explainable Formal Methods","Model checking;Visualization;Integrated circuit modeling;Tools;Computational modeling;Encoding;Process control","","5","","88","IEEE","29 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

They are becoming more common and impactful, raising serious concerns for individuals as well as companies. Literature review: Although there is considerable literature on users’ mental models in security and privacy, there has been limited study of mental models related to data breaches. Research questions: 1. How do users understand data breaches? 2. What are their perceptions of the causes, responsibilities, and consequences, as well as possible prevention and appropriate follow up? Methodology: We explored end-user understanding of internet data breaches by conducting a study with 35 participants. They were asked to draw their understanding of data breaches and answer some open-ended and closed-ended questions afterwards. Results/discussion: Although their drawings varied in detail and complexity, we identified four patterns in the participants’ drawings: they illustrated abstractions of attacks to gain administrator access, end-user access, backdoor access, or access using database server vulnerabilities. We found that participants had a basic model of how an internet data breach happens, but with significant uncertainties regarding system vulnerabilities, causes, consequences, prevention methods, and follow-up steps after a breach. Conclusions: In all, end-user mental models of internet data breaches are basic and show gaps that emphasize the need for improved communication to increase users’ awareness and help them hold companies accountable.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2021.3110545","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9580451","Cybersecurity;internet data breaches;mental models","Data breach;Cognitive science;Security;Biological system modeling;Computer security;Computational modeling;Internet","","5","","30","IEEE","19 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing methods mainly rely on the input image to generate descriptions. However, many abstract medical concepts or descriptions cannot be generated based on image information only. In this work, we integrate additional information to help solve this task; we observe that early in the diagnosis process, ophthalmologists have usually written down a small set of keywords denoting important information. These keywords are then subsequently used to aid the later creation of medical reports for a patient. Since these keywords commonly exist and are useful for generating medical reports, we incorporate them into automatic report generation. Since we have two types of inputs expert-defined unordered keywords and images - effectively fusing features from these different modalities is challenging. To that end, we propose a new keyword-driven medical report generation method based on a non-local attention-based multi-modal feature fusion approach, TransFuser, which is capable of fusing features from different types of inputs based on such attention. Our experiments show the proposed method successfully captures the mutual information of keywords and image content. We further show our proposed keyword-driven generation model reinforced by the TransFuser is superior to baselines under the popular text evaluation metrics BLEU, CIDEr, and ROUGE.

In measuring the effectiveness of teaching security concepts with the MEA project, students’ performance, attitudes, and interests as well as the instructor’s effectiveness were assessed. For the conceptual modeling tasks in problem-solving, the results of student outcomes were analyzed. After implementing the security modules with the MEA project, students showed a great understanding of cyber security concepts and an increased interest in broader computer science concepts. The instructor’s beliefs about teaching, learning, and assessment shifted from teacher-centered to student-centered during their experience with the security modules and MEA project.

In previous work, we proposed an approach to extend the system's modeling language with new monitoring and action dimensions. However, the solution generates a high number of new language elements, slowing down the reasoning process for large systems. In this position paper, we propose a multi-level approach for extending the modeling language at runtime, and aim to provide online learning and reasoning at multiple levels of abstraction. Increasing the modeling abstraction decreases the number of concepts to reason about, hence improving scalability.

The radical-based zero-shot Chinese character recognition methods treat Chinese characters as a combination of radicals and structures, and recognize Chinese characters by identifying the radicals and structures contained in them. Current approaches generally treat the contribution of all radicals to Chinese character recognition as the same, and the recognition results rely on the network’s ability to recognize radicals and their corresponding position information, ignoring the potential value of radicals themselves in eliminating the uncertainty of Chinese characters. In this paper, we model the problem of radical-based Chinese character recognition as an uncertainty elimination problem and propose a Critical Radical Analysis Network (CRAN) to explore the Ideographic Description Sequence (IDS) information for zero-shot Chinese character recognition. Specifically, we propose a novel method to compute the critical values of radicals based on information theory using the predefined Chinese character IDS dictionary. In recognition, we use an iterative approach to translate the predicted radical sequence to target Chinese characters. That is, the radicals of the predicted sequence are sorted in descending order of the critical value, and then the radicals are continuously selected in this order as the information obtained to eliminate the uncertainty of the Chinese character until the character is recognized. We conduct experiments on the CTW, CASIA-AHCDB, and CASIA-HWDB datasets.

Universities must consider funneling more resources into computing programs to address faculty’s increasing workload.

Computing teaching has many challenges, as it requires different skills from students, often subjective and difficult to assess. In fact, technical knowledge alone is not enough to fully understand what is being taught, but the interpretive and logical skills to deal with practical problems and non-technical skills such as group work, creativity, critical vision, ability to cooperate and communicate. Active learning methodologies as Problem-Based Learning (PBL) have been used to dealing with such challenges, broadly developing technical and non-techniques skills in students. However, despite the benefits of PBL, the student assessment process is one of the points that present its own adversities and, therefore, an aspect that deserves greater attention. To better understand the nuances of this process and how it can contributes to the teaching and learning process based on PBL, this study aimed to investigate primary studies in the last two decades, seeking answers to the following research questions: RQ1) What assessment models are being used?; RQ2) Which aspects are evaluated?; RQ3) What criteria and media have been defined?; RQ4) Who gets involved in the assessment process?; RQ5) What is the ideal frequency to conduct the evaluations?; RQ6) What can these models reveal? As a research method, this study used the Systematic Literature Review method proposed by Kitchenham. As main conclusions, it was possible to identify that: generally, computing education based on PBL occurs at the undergraduate level, having as main educational objective the teaching of technical content; in practice, the need for a diverse teaching team is not reflected, the traditional student-teacher remains; to evaluate students, it is necessary to consider several aspects, technical and non-technical, defining specific criteria for each one of them; the main benefits for students are related to changes in behavior, development of soft skills and better absorption of technical knowledge; as main challenges for students, the difficulty to understand the nuances of the proposed problem and to be the main responsible for devising a solution for it without the figure of a teacher to give a clear definition of how to do it stands out.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637056","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637056","Computing Education;Problem-Based Learning;PBL;Student Assessment","Systematics;Computational modeling;Education;Proposals;Problem-solving;Object recognition;Usability","","","","65","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

How they cope with these situations is crucial to their well-being. Research shows that people may change their beliefs to perceive the situations in a better, less-stressful light. Therefore, understanding how people change their beliefs to cope with stress and emotion is an important research question. Toward that end, we model coping, based on Lazarus's appraisal theory of emotion, as a two-step decision problem. However, people do not hallucinate arbitrary alternative realities in order to reduce stress. So a central challenge here is to model the constraints on belief change. We specifically stipulate two key factors influencing the degree of belief change: the utility of holding the alternative belief and constraints on changing a belief based on its underlying uncertainty. To investigate these factors and the model's assumptions, we applied the model to a simple hurricane situation and conducted an experiment based on this situation, where participants observed hurricane information and reported their beliefs about it. We found that when the hurricane worsens, those who stayed believe the hurricane to be less severe than the most likely outcome from the information and those who evacuated. The results also show that the uncertainty of information and the utility of the beliefs about that information is related and together determine how emotion-focused coping alters the person's beliefs. Overall, the results support the assumptions and predictions of the model. These findings illustrate the relevance of applying a decision-making model analysis to coping.","2156-8111","978-1-6654-5908-2","10.1109/ACII55700.2022.9953834","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CMMI-1638234); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953834","Coping;Appraisal Theory;Modeling;Hurricane","Analytical models;Affective computing;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Anxiety disorders;Decision making;Predictive models","","","","35","IEEE","25 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To analyze this process, the community of inquiry (CoI) theoretical model played a central role in our study, especially in the interaction between online pedagogical mediation and the elements that constitute this model, considered interdependent and crucial for a successful higher educational experience: teaching presence, social presence, and cognitive presence. Data was collected with a questionnaire survey, which allowed us to identify the student’s conception of online pedagogical mediation and to assess the perception on the development of the presences of the CoI model in the pedagogical mediation used in the course VLE. The results suggest that most students share the perception that online pedagogical mediation is related to the role played by teachers and tutors.

It has a wider space of membership degrees. Thus, it is more capable in expressing and handling the fuzzy information in engineering practice and scientific research. However, PFSs lack a mathematical tool to express stochastic or probability information, rendering it unsuitable for application in many scenarios. In this article, an ordered number pair is used to describe fuzzy information and stochastic information under uncertain environments, namely constrained Pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS). The CPFS has two components, $\text{CPFS}=(A,P)$, where $A$ is the classical PFS, while $P$ is a measurement of reliability for $A$. For PFS, CPFS is the first unified description of fuzzy information and probabilistic information, which is a more flexible way to describe knowledge or thinking. Furthermore, the similarity measure of CPFSs is presented, which meets the similarity measure theorems and can better indicate the flexibility of CPFSs. Numerical examples are used to demonstrate that the CPFSs similarity measure is reasonable and effective. The method of similarity measure can be degenerated to the similarity measure of PFSs under specific case and can avoid generating counter-intuitive results. In addition, similarity measure of CPFSs is applied to medical diagnosis and target classification of Iris. These experimental results have proven the practicability and effectiveness of our model.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2021.3052559","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973332); JSPS Invitational Fellowships for Research in Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9328276","Constrained pythagorean fuzzy set (CPFS);fuzzy information;similarity measure;stochastic information","Fuzzy sets;Reliability theory;Stochastic processes;Medical diagnosis;Uncertainty;Tools;Iris","","29","","81","IEEE","18 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes a method to construct classifiers from multiresolution hierarchical granular representations using hyperbox fuzzy sets. The proposed approach forms a series of granular inferences hierarchically through many levels of abstraction. An attractive characteristic of our classifier is that it can maintain a high accuracy in comparison to other fuzzy min-max models at a low degree of granularity based on reusing the knowledge learned from lower levels of abstraction. In addition, our approach can reduce the data size significantly as well as handle the uncertainty and incompleteness associated with data in real-world applications. The construction process of the classifier consists of two phases. The first phase is to formulate the model at the greatest level of granularity, while the later stage aims to reduce the complexity of the constructed model and deduce it from data at higher abstraction levels.

"To Incentivize or Not: Impact of Blockchain-Based Cryptoeconomic Tokens on Human Information Sharing Behavior","M. C. Ballandies","Department of Computational Social Science, ETH Zürich, Zürich, Switzerland",IEEE Access,"28 Jul 2022","2022","10","","74111","74130","Cryptoeconomic incentives in the form of blockchain-based tokens are seen as an enabler of the sharing economy that could shift society towards greater sustainability. Nevertheless, knowledge of the impact of these tokens on human sharing behavior is still limited and this poses a challenge to the design of effective cryptoeconomic incentives. This study applies the theory of self-determination to investigate the impact of such tokens on human behavior in an information-sharing scenario. By utilizing an experimental methodology in the form of a randomized control trial with a  $2 \times 2$  factorial design involving 132 participants, the effects of two token incentives on human information-sharing behavior are analyzed. Individuals obtain these tokens in exchange for their shared information. Based on the collected tokens, individuals receive a monetary payment and build reputation. Besides investigating the effect of these incentives on the quantity of shared information, the study includes quality characteristics of the information, such as accuracy and contextualization. The focus on quantity while excluding quality has been identified as a limitation in previous work. In addition to confirming previously known effects such as a crowding-out of intrinsic motivation by incentives, which also exists for blockchain-based tokens, the findings of this paper point to a hitherto unreported interaction effect between multiple tokens when applied simultaneously. The findings are critically discussed and put into the context of recent work and ethical considerations. The theory-based-empirical study is of interest to those investigating the effect of cryptoeconomic tokens or digital currencies on human behavior and supports the community in the design of effective personalized incentives for sharing economies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3189774","ETH Library Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9825658","Blockchain;cryptoeconomics;distributed ledger technology;incentives;information sharing;self-determination theory;token economics;token engineering","Behavioral sciences;Information sharing;Blockchains;Sharing economy;Distributed ledgers;Information sharing;Economics;Token networks;Cryptocurrencies","","12","","103","CCBY","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this research, a deep learning model is introduced to improve Alzheimer's stage diagnosis. The Hybrid deep model is designed to detect abnormal changes in brain (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) MRI scans. It utilizes the multi-class log loss (MCLL) function as the objective function to reduce the error rate in detecting AD stages. The MCLL approach computes the variations in actual and detected AD stages of each biomarkers features of input MRI images to identify loss rate. It helps to reduce the loss rate in AD stages detection. Moreover, the Hybrid deep learning model for Alzheimer stages detection (HDLMASD)system analysis the images deeply to provide accurate biomarkers detection with the help of all essential biomarkers processing steps. The efficiency of the Alzheimer stages diagnosis system is evaluated with various evaluation metrics. Finally, a comparative analysis is made with multiple present diagnosis systems to verify the performance of the AD detection system.

Nevertheless, in many ways, what this class of technologies has offered as return on investment remains less impressive than what has been promised. In the present paper, we argue that the continued failure to realize the potential in modern AI and AI-related technologies is largely attributable to the oversimplified, yet pervasive ways that our global society treats the relationship between these technologies and humans. Oversimplified concepts, once conveyed, tend to perpetuate myths that in turn limit the impact of such technologies in human society. To counter these oversimplifications, we offer a theoretical construct, which we call the landscape of human-AI partnership. This construct characterizes individual capability for real-world task performance as a dynamic function of information certainty, available time to respond, and task complexity. With this, our goal is to encourage more nuanced discourse about novel ways to solve challenges to modern and future sociotechnical societies, but without defaulting to notions that remain rooted in today's technologies-as-tools ways of thinking. The core of our argument is that society at large must recognize that intelligent technologies are evolving well beyond being mere tools for human use and are instead becoming capable of operating as interdependent teammates. This means that how we think about interactions between humans and AI needs to go beyond a “Human-or-AI” conversation about task assignments to more contextualized “Human-and-AI” way of thinking about how best to capitalize on the strengths hidden within emergent capabilities of unique human-AI partnerships that have yet to be fully realized.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3078298","U.S. Department of Defense through the Human Autonomy Teaming Essential Research Program of the U.S. DEVCOM Army Research Laboratory; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9425540","Human-AI partnership;human-autonomy teaming;sociotechnical systems;AI ecosystems;function allocation;task complexity;capability;use cases;implementation","Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Complexity theory;Tools;Robot sensing systems;Ecosystems;Aging","","5","","143","CCBY","7 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The emergence of mobile-edge computing (MEC) provides a good thinking to solve this challenge. In this article, we study an energy-efficient task offloading and resource allocation scheme for AR in both the single-MEC and multi-MEC systems. First, a more specific and detailed AR application model is established as a directed acyclic graph according to its internal functionality. Second, based on this AR model, a joint optimization problem of task offloading and resource allocation is formulated to minimize the energy consumption of each user subject to the latency requirement and the limited resources. The problem is a mixed multiuser competition and cooperation problem, which involves the task offloading decision, uplink/downlink transmission resources allocation, and computing resources allocation of users and MEC server. Since it is an NP-hard problem and the communication environment is dynamic, it is difficult for genetic algorithms or heuristic algorithms to solve. Therefore, we propose an intelligent and efficient resource allocation and task offloading algorithm based on the deep reinforcement learning framework of multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) in a dynamic communication environment. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the energy consumption of each user terminal.","2327-4662","","10.1109/JIOT.2021.3050804","Shaanxi Key Research and Development Program(grant numbers:2018ZDCXL-GY-04-03-02); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9319727","Augmented reality (AR);deep reinforcement learning;Internet of Things (IoT);mobile-edge computing (MEC);multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG);resource allocation;task offloading","Task analysis;Servers;Optimization;Resource management;Energy consumption;Computational modeling;Heuristic algorithms","","92","","43","IEEE","11 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Data science gives us a way of knowing the world and finding the mechanism hidden in the data. Automatic tool like polynomial fitting is a useful method to fit the data well. When the variable number and degree are relatively low, the computation amount of polynomial is small. However, the number of monomials grows exponentially with the increasing variable number and degree. Problems in the real world are always in a high-dimension, and the problem may be complex that needs to use a high degree to fit data well. Plus, with the huge data, the computation complexity is high. Therefore, we think it is necessary to find a way to reduce the computation amount of fitted polynomial. In this paper, we propose to use the PSO algorithm to find the monomial sets that have lower computation amounts. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method.","","978-1-6654-1327-5","10.1109/HPBDIS53214.2021.9658463","Research and Development; Beijing Technology and Business University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9658463","polynomial fitting;computation complexity;optimization problem;pattern recognition","Fitting;Data science;Computational complexity;Physics","","1","","14","IEEE","3 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the early stages, this condition is thought to cause minimal memory loss, but as the disease progresses, it causes some loss of ability during discussion. It is a brain illness in which memory is progressively lost along with the capacity to think and carry out some daily duties. Some areas of the brain are also involved, including those that regulate the ability to think, remember, and use language. Alzheimer's treatment choices vary depending on whether or not the Alzheimer's is present. An Alzheimer's disease biopsy is required prior to final brain surgery in order to confirm the diagnosis. There are an estimated 6 million persons in the United States who suffer from Alzheimer's disease, and the majority of them are over the age of 65. Memory and other essential internal processes are lost as brain cell connections and cells themselves degrade and die. The most common signs and symptoms are disorientation and loss of memory. There is no cure, however medications and surgical procedures can alleviate symptoms for a while. For example, there are various hazard features to an Alzheimer's complaint, as well as a requirement for time to gather correct and accepted procedures in order to form an early assessment and resolve the complaint as quickly as possible. Data mining is a common practice in the healthcare industry for reusing large amounts of data. To better understand Alzheimer's disease, researchers use data mining and machine learning approaches to evaluate large volumes of medical information. Machine learning is being used to develop a model for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease at this time. In order to estimate the rise, various algorithms are examined and a current model is employed.","","978-1-6654-7657-7","10.1109/ICTACS56270.2022.9988214","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9988214","Alzheimer's disease Prediction;Machine Learning;SMLT","Training;Surgery;Machine learning;Medical services;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Data models","","","","21","IEEE","28 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To cope with these challenges, most of the organizations rely on the adoption of cryptographic methods for protecting data against any illegitimate access and attacks. Modern day cryptographic ciphers utilize one or more substitution-boxes (S-boxes) that facilitate the realisation of strong security of plain data during encryption and legal decoding of it during decryption process. Security of ciphers is directly proportional to the cryptographic strength of S-boxes. This study proposes an efficient and simple method based on some modular operations for the construction of dynamic S-boxes with high nonlinearity using a heuristic evolution strategy. A large number of strong S-boxes can be easily constructed using slight variations in the parameters of the anticipated method. A specimen S-box is constructed and its critical performance analysis against standard security criteria including nonlinearity, strict avalanche criterion, bit independence criterion, differential uniformity, linear probability, and fixed points are reported as justification for the proposed technique's high cryptographic strength. Furthermore, the generated S-box is also applied to encrypt digital images to assess its cryptographic application performance. The performance and comparison study validates that the proposed S-box has better performance strength, which makes it a viable candidate for cryptographic applications in different areas of image security.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3077194","Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University, Saudi Arabia via the Deanship for Scientific Research; Advanced Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Systems Engineering (ACIISE) Research Group(grant numbers:2020/01/12173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9420690","Security and privacy;substitution-box;block ciphers;encryption;image security;cyber physical systems","Ciphers;Security;Encryption;Matrix converters;Streaming media;Performance analysis;Computer science","","31","","76","CCBY","3 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the Applications nowadays, content on the platform exists far in advance even before a user thinks to watch it. It can be preprocessed easily. Heavy compression techniques can be used and videos can be prepared with different qualities and transmission rates. In past some decades devices on which streaming is done have been transformed totally from televisions to OTTs which stream a large amount of content. Also, various electronic gadgets like laptops, tablets etc. provide ease to users to watch the content with portable facility. It has been noted that among all the sites browsed, streaming websites/services holds around 60% of all. The basic idea behind implementing the modules is that some content is widely available over the internet and is accessible to everyone irrespective of their age. Also, people are using these platforms as a source of entertainment for most of the time during the day which eventually leads to eye problems.

One of the main issues that farmers face is a lack of information regarding the necessary fertiliser amounts. Farmers think that when fertiliser use rises, production rises as well. This, however, is untrue since the soil just uses what it need and leaves the remainder behind. Overuse results in leaching, a decrease in the natural fertility of the soil, and other problems. A solution is to make it possible for farmers to test their soil and use fertilisers in accordance with the needs of the soil at a reasonable cost. This study describes the development of a low-cost soil nutrient detection method using pre-made capsules. Here, it is possible to do three different nutritional tests for sodium, potassium, and phosphorus. In this experiment, three test tubes are used, and after adding varied amounts of dirt and water to each, the mixture is stirred for 15 minutes. After then, the tube starts to change colour. A colour sensor is used in this instance, and it recognises the colour shift in the test tubes and compares it to the information previously known about the colour deficit. The farmer is advised of the shortage and how much fertiliser is necessary to make up for it once the sensor data is analysed using Arduino.","","978-1-6654-7655-3","10.1109/ICCST55948.2022.10040291","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10040291","","Costs;Image color analysis;Scientific computing;Sodium;Crops;Production;Soil","","","","5","IEEE","14 Feb 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Domain shifts usually exist in both marginal distribution and conditional distribution, and their relative importance varies with datasets. Moreover, there is an influence between marginal distribution distance and conditional distribution distance. However, joint domain adaptation approaches rarely consider those. Existing dynamic distribution alignment methods require a feature discriminator, and they need to train a subdomain discriminator for each class. Besides, they don't think about the interaction between the two distribution distances. In this article, we propose a dynamic joint domain adaptation approach, namely Joint Domain Adaptation Based on Adversarial Dynamic Parameter Learning (ADPL), to deal with the above problems. Both marginal distribution alignment and conditional distribution alignment can be implemented by adversarial learning. The dynamic algorithm can keep a balance between marginal and conditional distribution alignment with only two domain discriminators. In addition, the dynamic algorithm takes the influence between the two distribution distances into consideration. Compared with several advanced domain adaptation methods on both text and image datasets, all classification experiments and extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that ADPL has higher learning performance of classification and less running time. This reveals that ADPL outperforms the state-of-the-art domain adaptation approaches.","2471-285X","","10.1109/TETCI.2021.3055873","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2016YFB0800402,2016QY01W0202); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1936108,U1836204,61433006,U1401258,61572221,61502185); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9355329","Domain adaptation;joint distribution alignment;adversarial learning;dynamic distribution alignment","Adversarial learning;Feature extraction;Generative adversarial networks;Supervised learning","","7","","23","IEEE","17 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the process of obtaining information is a complex task, which can consider the rational, conscious, objective evaluation of utility with behavioral effects. Besides, in most cases, information can be obtained from different angles at the same time. The quantum model of mass function (QM) uses amplitude and phase angle to easily express those properties of information that can extend D-S evidence theory to the unit circle in a complex plane. Moreover, everything in nature will have its opposite, which is a kind of universality. The Bayes theorem is essentially the process of negation. However, in most cases, decisions can be made by only fully considering the known information without considering the other side of the information. Hence, considering the negation of information is a question to be investigated deeply, which can analyze information from the other point. This article proposes negation of QM by using the subtraction of vectors in the unit circle, which can degenerate into negation proposed by Yager in standard probability theory and negation proposed by Yin et al. in D-S evidence theory. Negation can provide us more information to consider the problem from both positive and negative aspects. In this article, negation can be understood information, which does not belong to event $A$, that is to say, negation can be regarded as nonmembership by using the fuzzy terms. Based on the above discussion, this article proposes the quantum pythagorean fuzzy evidence theory (QPFET), which is the novel work to consider QPFET from the point of negation. Besides, there are some numerical examples to explain the proposed method. In order to explore the applications of QPFET, this article discusses the possibility of the VI $\check{s}$ ekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje method under QPFET to handle multicriteria decision-making that enables us to capture 2-D data, considering not only amplitude but also phase angle.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2021.3057993","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61973332); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science Invitational Fellowships for Research in Japan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351642","Dempster–Shafer (D-S) evidence theory;negation;pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs);quantum mass function;quantum pythagorean fuzzy evidence theory (QPFET);VI $\check{s}$ ekriterijumsko Kompromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR)","Evidence theory;Quantum mechanics;Fuzzy sets;Decision making;Tools;Quantum computing;Standards","","33","","64","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

From a novel perspective that can easily remove this flaw, this study uses a systematical frame to better redefine induced OWA operators, which not only covers all the spirits of the original definition of induced OWA operator but also extends it to some wider understandings and usages. One significant feature related to this frame is that we can express induced OWA operators fully in terms of weighted averaging operators, making the usages and expressions of induced OWA operators much more flexible and stricter. In detail, we propose several new definitions, such as positioning transformation, permutation-based orness, and inducing function based orness.

When they live apart from their family, there is a risk of them suffering from serious disturbance in mental ability including delirium due to stress [1] [2]. Their family can visit hospital or sheltered accomodation and meet senior citizens so as to reduce their stress and prevent them from suffering serious disturbance. However they might not be able to do so due to epidemics. They can communicate with their family as in the case of life when they live in same house by making constant video calls instead of visit. However, they may feel uncomfortable with constant shooting. We feel a need of the system that they can communicate without feeling uncomfortable even if senior citizens live apart from their family. When we came to think of the place where the families lived in comfortably, the living room came to our mind. Family live freely in the living room, spending much of their time without a strong connection each other. But a person can start a conversation at any time by talking to another person, and the conversation will end naturally without clear termination signal. For this reason, we have proposed “Virtual living room system” [3] that had these feature and reproduced a real living room. We made an experimental system in order to verify the validity of the system and conducted experiments that we had subjects live while using it. In the experiment, we confirm the usefulness of the system. However, we also confirm two problems through the opinions of participants. One is the lack of presence. The system displays an icon on the screen that represents the the information of whether person that lives away from the user is in a certain room or not. The icon is not related to the user, so it may not have made the users feel that they live in the same place. The other is the difficulty of setting up for using the system. Setting up this system is not easy for people who are not very familiar with computer operation. The system will actually be used in a hospital or nursing home. Therefore the staff work in would have to set up the system and help the user use it. They may be unfamiliar with computer operation and probably cannot set up the system and use it by theirselves.

As we know most of the farmers in our country are illiterate, have no proper knowledge about the disease, that's why they cannot manually detect the disease. I think if you properly detect the disease at the early stage we can solve the issue. We develop a model that can classify leaf disease. We focus on 5 major production crops in Bangladesh. Using computer vision technique our farmer will get the benefit. We use convolutional neural networks for classifying images. An algorithm cannot properly capture the features of existing data that's why we use a pre-trained feature extraction method that is MobileNetv2. MobileNetv2 is very useful for mobile devices. The research contains the proportions of validation accuracy of 90.38%. This approach resulted in the agriculture sector that will help a farmer to classify disease from harvest. The main goal of our model is to minimize the damage of suffering plants that can help to the growth of production. By solving this issue themselves farmers can also reduce cost. Our goal is that they can cure their crop at the right time. To achieve this goal we tend to think that we should develop a way to detect the leaf disease.

The Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) dataset is being used in our research paper, consisting of 16 categories of postings with an amount of 8675 posts. We classified four personality traits from the input text, namely Introversion-Extroversion (I-E), Intuitions-Sensing (N-S), Feeling-Thinking (F-T), and Judging-Perceiving (J-P). We have initially adopted several preprocessing techniques to fit these text data into our proposed machine learning model. Text preprocessing methods include tokenization, word stemming, stop words deletion. After preprocessing, features like tf-idf and countvector were extracted. The model was then trained with six state-of-the-arts classifiers. After evaluating the model, it was found that the SVM outperformed all other classifiers and proved better than the other existing works also.","","978-1-6654-5262-5","10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984495","Personality prediction;Machine learning;Natural language processing;MBTI;Social Media;Support Vector Machine","Support vector machines;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Semantics;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms","","3","","20","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

If they search since the internet, they get their answers directly but without knowing the base from how it came. Therefore, everyone is trying to reach the upcoming technologies without strong in their basics. Hence, a model is created with the help of toolkit (like courseware, etc.) where the technology behind this is AI. This toolkit (packaged to use with computers) comes up with different subjects (subjects were designed based on the year of study). After a concept is thought to an individual or if a concept is learned individually, this toolkit works as a tester and gives the performance and feedback on the level of their understanding. On analyzing the results, the perspective of each individual is identified. The data is passed to ANN, each level of students is happened and the metrics have shown an efficiency of 94.3%. The result produced for each individual is given to an AI model. According to the perspective of each individual, automatic questions are generated by the AI model to increase their level of knowledge and the way of thinking. It helps every individual to be strong in their concepts and no need for searching the answers for every question. Therefore, it is understood that the proposed model has higher efficiency 95% in training the students and teaching the concepts as well.","","978-1-6654-5262-5","10.1109/ICCCNT54827.2022.9984278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9984278","artificial intelligence;ANN;courseware;multilayer perceptron;backpropagation algorithm;training model","Training;Measurement;Courseware;Computers;Computational modeling;Mobile handsets;Artificial intelligence","","1","","20","IEEE","26 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing methods suffer from the less flexibility and low efficiency. This article proposes a novel methodology to address these problems. It mimics the principle that the human’s brain can still think, even when he/she neither receives any sensory stimulus nor performs any action, during the off-task process, a gated self-organization mechanism is used to trigger the “brain” of the mobile robot to work, analyze the scenarios that it encountered in the former tasks to decide the best moving direction, then store the sensed scenario information by means of the lateral excitation of the internal neurons in a developmental network (DN), and set up the weight connections from the internal area to high-level decision-making area of the DN. In the following PL, if the robot encounters a similar scenario, it can make a better and faster behavior decision. Therefore, this methodology can greatly enhance the efficiency of behavior decision with the limited training samples, without retraining in facing a new scenario. Most importantly, this methodology makes the robot continuously improve its intelligence through the autonomous learning, even in offline state. Extensive simulation and experiment results of the mobile robot PL demonstrate its potential. Since it is task nonspecific, the same learning principles are potentially suitable for other fields. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first trial to apply the transfer learning through the lateral excitation mechanism of internal neurons to the robot field with the emergent representation.","2379-8939","","10.1109/TCDS.2021.3128179","National Natural Science Funds of China(grant numbers:62173309,62173311,61873245); Natural Science Funds of Henan Province(grant numbers:202300410483); Scientific Problem Tackling of Henan Province(grant numbers:192102210256); Henan Province College Youth Backbone Teacher Project(grant numbers:2021GGJS001); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9615356","Behavior decision;developmental network (DN);gated self-organization mechanism;lateral excitation;off-task process;transfer","Transfer learning;Behavioral sciences;Mobile robots;Neurons;Decision making;Visualization;Robot sensing systems","","","","60","IEEE","16 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the large number of students, it is impractical for instructors to manually assess all the work of each student to provide tailored feedback. We design and implement Automatic Programming Coach (AP-Coach), a web-based tool for automatically generating formative feedback for exercises on basic programming concepts. AP-Coach combines software engineering techniques (code similarity measures based on abstract syntax trees, and unit testing), and AI techniques (machine translation) in a novel manner to provide relevant feedback.

In computer science education a majority of games and approaches exist, that provide engaging environments for students. On the one hand, these can be games related to learning algorithmic thinking but on the other hand, games to learn coding. Besides single-player games, there are also multiplayer games where players compete against each other or collaboratively work on programming tasks. However, many existing multiplayer games offer pre-defined levels where teachers have limited flexibility and individuality for their students. Additionally, many existing game environments use competitive over collaborative approaches. In our project, we extended an existing game by a multiplayer mode where players work together on coding tasks. The game elements support many coding-related concepts but also computational skills such as sequencing, conditionals, loops, and also advanced topics such as concurrency or dependencies using meaningful levels and tasks. However, we conducted an evaluation including 41 participants in three workshops: two in-class activities with secondary school students and an online activity with computer science students. Within these workshops, the students collaboratively worked on coding tasks within the game environment. Thereby, we observed the communication between the students while working on the tasks. Additionally, we evaluated the students’ attitudes towards collaborative learning. We found out that the in-game chat is barely used while in-class activities, especially when the tasks require only low coordination between players. We also found out, that students learn from each other and are more motivated when working together. With our approach, we want to provide educators with a flexible game environment where students can collaboratively improve their coding skills while solving engaging tasks.","","978-1-7348995-3-5","10.23919/iLRN55037.2022.9815973","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9815973","game-based learning;coding;collaborative learning","Concurrent computing;Sequential analysis;Conferences;Games;Collaborative work;Encoding;Serious games","","1","","18","","11 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Under that framework, and when the credibility measure is employed, we adopt a fuzzy chance-constrained programming setting to convert the fuzzy model into its crisp counterpart. Afterwards, an analytical method based on fuzzy operational law is proposed to further transform the chance-constrained programming into an equivalent explicit model that can be solved directly by a standard commercial software. For a targeted group of customers, a new yoghurt design is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of our treatment.

Mostly people express their views and share their thoughts in their mother Tongue along with usage of mixed language words is common nowadays. Hence Sentiment analysis of codemixed language plays a major role. There is only little work available in Tamil mixed Sentiment analysis. In order to know the opinion of people who speak Tamil in an effective manner an effective algorithm is needed. Since there are many algorithms available in machine learning and deep learning, this work aims to find sentiment in code mixed words.

It consists of 7 boards (five triangles, one square and one parallelogram). Using tangram, we could build over 1600 kinds of shapes, such as houses, towers, and animals. However, it is very difficult to supplement a complete graphic with 7 boards. Therefore, this program was developed. In this program, the author used the DFS search algorithm and enumeration method to find all the solutions in the 13 convex figures in the Tangram. Then the author improved this search method to make the search algorithm run faster. The program is built using the Qt application development framework and C++ computer language and uses a user interface to display all the different results about the 13 convex graphics. The result of the research is that every convex polygon made of seven boards is not unique. Some graphics have only 16 transformations, but some will produce 224 different combinations of positions and colors.","","978-1-6654-0692-5","10.1109/CISAI54367.2021.00103","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9719135","DFS Algorithm;Tangram;convex figure;enumerate method","Graphics;Shape;Computational modeling;Search methods;Education;Poles and towers;Passwords","","3","","7","IEEE","28 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this context this paper will first contribute to the enrichment of the “computer aided design, (CAD)” modeler database by integrating data related to product functions. Then, it will enrich the data related to assembly constraints by the fit aspect. It would be useful if the designer can specify, when creating an assembly constraint between a shaft and a hub (either through bearings, bushings or by direct contact), the type of constraint fit (tight, loose or uncertain). This information will be necessary, for example, when automatically generating assembly or disassembly drawings. The main objective of the proposed paper is the development of two applications. The first application named “computer aided design part function, (CAD PF)”, used for the enrichment of the parts database by the part function. The second one named “computer aided design adjustment constraint type, (CAD ACT)”, used for the enrichment of the database of assemblies by the type of constraint adjustment during their creation.

The workplace problems for engineers in the 21st century demands interdisciplinary skills. To cater to the need, the educators need to make interventions for inculcating interdisciplinary skills among students. The challenge is that very limited focus is on preparing the faculty towards building interdisciplinary knowledge, skills and mentoring capabilities. The authors through this paper share an experience of deploying a faculty training model used for training the faculty towards mentoring interdisciplinary projects. The presented faculty development model is a result of the heuristic experience of four iterations and is organically evolved. The model was implemented in the context of a first-year engineering course titled Engineering Exploration. The course uses PBL pedagogy and every faculty, mentors a set of students to complete an interdisciplinary project. The nature of the projects in the course demands knowledge and skills from different domains to be applied at the mentioned stages. To mentor such interdisciplinary projects, faculty needs to be formally trained. However, in the literature authors found very limited architecture in the direction of standard frameworks and models that can be used to train the faculty towards interdisciplinary thinking and mentoring. The paper describes the evolved faculty training model consisting of four following phases where initial phases are focused on improving the technical skills among faculty members while the latter phase is focused on improving the mentoring skills.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637450","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637450","Faculty Development;Mentoring;Interdisciplinary Projects;Mentoring Skills","Training;Computer science;Computational modeling;Conferences;Employment;Prototypes;Mentoring","","2","","14","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve these long-term goals, it is necessary to introduce human cognitive-like abilities into AI systems to create truly self-adaptive artificially intelligent systems. This marriage of human cognitive skills with “machines” creates hybrid systems that have characteristics of both. The question becomes, which human cognitive model is appropriate for hybrid artificial intelligent systems. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the development of cognitive models to be infused into a modern radar system to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS). The notion of a hybrid artificially intelligent system can be divided into two main categories: (a) human-in-the-loop systems with hybrid augmented intelligence requiring human-AI communication/ collaboration, and (b) a cognitive computing-based AI in which a fully cognitive model is infused into the machine to allow fully autonomous operation. Here, we discuss the first type, human-in-the-loop cognitive radar systems that provide intelligent decision support and analysis for radar systems. The design of hybrid artificial intelligence methods and algorithms are presented with applications to improvement to modern radar systems, utilizing a Rasmussen Cognition Model (RCM), which we feel is appropriate for a hybrid cognitive system utilized to create a Cognitive Radar System (CRS).","","978-1-6654-2195-9","10.1109/WAMICON53991.2022.9786206","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9786206","","Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Neural networks;Training data;Cognitive radar;Mathematical models;Human in the loop","","2","","9","IEEE","6 Jun 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early game makers had little industry or resources. Space-time game modeling aids in computer game creation describes related topics and provides a game metamodel. Hand-coded parts and regulations make it harder to adapt to different game areas. MDD is an innovative software development method. Some people think drawing is enough to build a model. Diagrams are also needed. Models must have a well-defined, abstract syntax-illustrative structure consistent with met models. Building a space-time model for games allows for model language research.

In view of this, one acceleration algorithm based on multi-granularity attribute reduction (MGAR) for continuous parameters is designed to decrease the time consumption of acquiring reduct. In fact, the acceleration method we proposed is on the basis of the thinking of positive approximation. Specifically, the iterations of evaluating and selecting condition attributes are carried out on the progressively decreased universe instead of the entire sample space.

A pyramid is an excellent approach to reducing memory, and many papers said even low-resolution images or features contain enough information for estimating low-resolution depth maps. However, recent papers show that the higher the image resolution, the better the output depth map, which means the resolution of depth maps in each stage cause effect on the final outputs. Therefore, we think the low-resolution depth map may not be enough for the high-resolution depth map. In this paper, we propose a sub-pixel upsampling module for post-processing the cost volume to generate a big resolution depth map at each stage. Besides, we also proposed an edge-weighted loss function for optimizing those inaccurate depth values in the edge regions of objects.

The purpose of the paper is to identify and understand the prediction of the seizures that occur due to neurological disorder called Epilepsy. Epilepsy can be explained as the disorder of central nervous system, which results in abnormal activities inside the brain. The impacts of this disorder come out as seizures, and patient behaves in a weird manner. Sometimes the patient can even lose the track of consciousness and sensations, the power of thinking and reacting is also affected. When seen during Electroencephalogram, the brain wave patterns which are observed appear to be different and abnormal. It is one of the difficult diseases to be diagnosed. In this project, we have tried to find out the result as whether the patient is having an epileptic seizure or not, using machine learning models, like KNN, logistic regression and naïve bayes. The Output label column of the dataset has the value whether patient is having (1) or not having (0) a seizure. In this paper, we have preprocessed the dataset and calculated the accuracies of the models on both training and testing datasets. Dataset is extracted from GitHub and the coding is performed in python programming language. Python libraries like seaborn, matplotlib, pandas, numpyetc are used in the pre-processing of the model.

To use the BCI system in daily life, the BCI user should be able to achieve various tasks such as moving, text typing, and arm movements. In this paper, we propose a multi-functional BCI method that can predict various intentions simultaneously. To classify multiple intentions, we proposed two prediction models using Neural Networks (NN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) models. To evaluate the proposed BCI system, the classification accuracy of the model was measured and compared using steady state visually evoked potential (SSVEP), sensory motor rhythm (SMR), and both of them (Multiple Intention). The average prediction accuracies were 22.46% in NN, 55.86% in CNN. These results indicate that the proposed multi-functional BCI can predict multiple intentions.

However, for human intelligence, working memory is far from meeting the needs, especially in some advanced activities, such as thinking, language and emotion. Based on the concept driven processing theory, that is, the top-down processing mode of human perception, and the dualprocess theory of attention, that is, automatic processing and control processing based on the cognitive resource theory, this paper puts forward the computer neural network long-term memory storage model and the computer neural network dualprocess model, in order to construct the long-term memory of computer neural network, reduce the loss of computing time and computing resources, and improve the processing rate of information.

However, commuters really do not really think of the after effects caused by the floods. Commuting during water-logging is risky because the depth of logged water cannot be determined. This can lead to cars and bikes getting stuck inside the flooded zone. Thus travelling through such areas can lead to loss of life. Our paper focuses on the classification of floodwater depth. We propose a deep-learning model that classifies the depth of the flood water level into different categories according to the depth. In this paper, we have used the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the images given as an input by the user/commuter. For better user accessibility we propose to integrate the model with a cross-platform app that would be convenient for the commuters; along with an in-app alert system, which notifies other users about the location where the water level is above threshold value.","","978-1-7281-8519-4","10.1109/ESCI50559.2021.9397014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9397014","Flood;Deep Learning;CNN;Depth Classification;Alert system","Computational modeling;Monsoons;Floods;Convolutional neural networks;Automobiles;Informatics","","","","20","IEEE","9 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It presents some of the key concepts and tools as a summary: trustor/trustee separation, trust relationship description, virtualisation and trust, and trust domains. The flip side of thinking about the trust relationships that one system will form to other systems is for architect to consider the place of the system as a trustee: the recipient or target of those trust relationships. A key point is that the architect of trustee system should aim to have a good understanding of not only the functional uses to which the system may be put but also the trust contexts and risk concerns of potential trustors. Trust and risk lurk in all areas of the field of computing, from the smallest IoT device to the largest supercomputer, from wind turbines to online gaming, and from financial markets to educational institutions.","","9781119693017","10.1002/9781119695158.ch13","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821530.pdf&bkn=9820891&pdfType=chapter","","Security;Cloud computing;Resilience;Hardware;Computational modeling;Business;Trusted computing","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

The LDA model is used to mine the topic information in the texts in parallel corpora, and the polynomial distribution of thesaurus is used to represent the topic, so as to judge the proportion of each document topic in the document collection. The specific words are obtained according to the polynomial distribution of the corresponding thesaurus of the topic by probability sampling. The monolingual corpus of the target language is processed by maximum likelihood estimation method, and the parallel corpus is taken as the training target. The monolingual corpus of the target language is estimated by importance sampling and full probability formula, and a machine English translation model is established. The estimated expected value is obtained by beam search method, so that English sentence translation can be realized.

The LBL teaching method and the MOOC-based hybrid curriculum teaching methods were adopted, respectively. The effectiveness of the mixed method online and offline teaching mode was measured by a satisfaction survey and by comparing the examination results of the experimental group and the control group. Then, a second round of research was carried out. Asynchronous SPOCs were built on the basis of MOOC, and this kind of hybrid curriculum teaching was adopted. The online learning behaviors of 59 medical students of 2019, who participated in the course, were also analyzed. The average score of the experimental group (84.52±5.792) was higher than that of the control group (80.08±7.815). The results of the questionnaire showed that 72.6% of the students in the experimental group were willing to accept mixed curriculum teaching based on MOOC. The results of the second round of research show that there is a positive correlation between SOPCs online course scores and final scores, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.407 (P=0.001). The final scores of the course were generally over 70 points, and there was no linear correlation between the duration of watching learning videos and scores. The hybrid curriculum teaching based on MOOC+SPOCs can improve students' computing thinking ability and the teaching effect has been proved to be effective.

In the proposed Justice Secure Model, the victim voice data and records are prevented from data tampering using security policies. The criminal voice data are transformed into text using Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The voice data and records are secured by encrypting using Secured Hash Algorithm (SHA 256). To validate the access request, each victim records are embedded with private key. These private keys are securely transmitted by encrypting using modified AES algorithm. The above steps would avoid the internal data tampering and manipulating the victim case data. To address the external intrusion, our proposed methodology detects and prevent SQL injection attacks. Finally, to provide security of data at the server level, we have integrated multiple cloud storage system. The proposed system provide security at the application and server levels, thus making the unauthorized data access, intrusion, and data manipulation impossible.","","978-1-6654-1447-0","10.1109/ICCCT53315.2021.9711821","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9711821","Speech to text;Hidden Markov Model;SHA 256 algorithm;modified AES algorithm;multi-cloud storage","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Decision making;Hidden Markov models;SQL injection;Markov processes;Rendering (computer graphics)","","","","12","IEEE","18 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, deep learning has been widely used in object detection, segmentation and registration, especially the well-known work, PointNet, changed how we think about the representation of point clouds. However, the local information is ignored in PointNet as many works pointed out. In this paper, we advise to use graph attention to aggregate local features and a kind of cross attention method for point cloud registration. Firstly, we use a mini-ConvNet to extract point-wise features for sampled points and their neighbors. Then graph attention is applied to aggregate the local information from neighbor points to center points. We consider that previous works which directly estimate the transformation using the features from two point clouds ignore some relationship between the point clouds. Instead, we propose to explore the relation with a kind of cross attention.

Firstly, the software module is converted into an abstract syntax tree, and later it is traversed to extract word sequence of the software module. Then, thinking of the word sequence as input, acts on the self-attention layer to perform semantic feature embedding of the software module. Finally, the Softmax neural network is used to predict the software defect.

For this purpose, an onion-ring system called COSSOL has been built in a case study for Twitter, following a hybrid approach to integrate Machine Learning classifiers and structural metrics from Computational Linguistics and Computational Sociology disciplines, respectively. The paper designs two experimentation scenarios divided into cases of collective subjectivity analysis for Colombia under different levels of communities’ granularity. The first case validates the system by performing a cointegration test on the metrics of each construct for the onion rings’ communities. The results show that some communities better propagate their subjective expressions against the disclosed topic when they have a higher network density and a common polarity. Moreover, the most stable communities in polarity towards a topic are those whose members are highly connected. Conversely, communities with a higher centrality index in a subset of members do not exhibit stability in collective subjectivity towards a topic disclosed in that community. The second case validates the model with a series of Social Network Analysis (SNA) metrics with a polarity layer to describe the second onion ring subcommunities and their temporal variation through community recalculation. The results show no polar distributions similar to the bimodal ones representing consensus in the values of the common Thinking Acting and Feeling (TAF) forms.

Takayama","Department of Computational Media, University of California, Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, California, USA",2022 17th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI),"29 Sep 2022","2022","","","1","1","As the Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research field is relatively young and interdisciplinary, we spend a good deal of time and effort on communicating with each other, sharing ideas and empirical findings across disciplinary boundaries. While this practice is important and needs to continue, there is an increasingly pressing need for us to also communicate outside of this research community. I have met way too many designers, engineers, product managers, and roboticists, who tell me that they were either unaware that there was an HRI research community or that they have found our research community and have been disappointed by our work. That is unfortunate and it is fixable. Like the Human-Computer Interaction research community, we need to tackle this research-practice gap [1]. In this talk, I will make the case for why and how we might get started. There is so much to be gained by taking a Translational Science approach to HRI research. There are opportunities to do work that is grounded in real world problems, real people, and real robots. Furthermore, there are opportunities to make a difference in the design and deployment of robotic products and services right now. As just one example, in spending time studying robot deployments in service industries, at sea, and in the sky, we kept meeting professional Robot Wranglers. In many of our research projects, graduate students take on the Robot Wrangler role, which we claim will eventually disappear when the robots become “fully” autonomous. Looking across many industries, I believe that Robot Wranglers are here to stay. We could and should study them as real stakeholders and people. As HRI researchers, we have an opportunity to use our work to more directly inform the design of technologies. We can also find inspiration from the study of empirical [2]. I think it is time to roll up our sleeves and get better at communicating and working with the people who are building the future of robotics now. Publishing and presenting peer-reviewed papers is not where our work ends. We have much more work to do in translating our work in ways that will help others outside of our research community actually make use of our insights, engaging in collaborations with them, and coming back here to share and learn from stories about those experiences.","","978-1-6654-0731-1","10.1109/HRI53351.2022.9889659","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889659","human-robot interaction;translational science;robot wranglers;science communication;research-practice gap","Industries;Human computer interaction;Translational research;Service robots;Publishing;Buildings;Collaboration","","4","","2","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It explains why there was rarely man-made AS in the past half century, because of the theoretical, mathematical, computational, and programming language unreadiness. Therefore, the ultimate goal of AS is to implement a brain-inspired system that may think and behave as a human counterpart in hybrid intelligent systems and general AI implementations.

However, most restrict access to the outside world, limiting learners to commands and computing resources built in to the environment. Some allow learners to drag and drop files, connect to sensors and robots locally or issue HTTP requests. But in a world where most of the applications in our daily lives are distributed (i.e., their functionality depends on communicating with other programs or accessing resources and data on the internet), the lack of support for beginners to envision and create such distributed programs is a lost opportunity. This paper argues that it is not only feasible, but crucial, to create environments with simple yet powerful abstractions that open up distributed computing and other widely used but advanced computing concepts including networking, the Internet of Things, and cybersecurity to novices. By thus removing the walls around our environments, we can expand opportunities for learning considerably: programs can access a wealth of online data and web services, and communicate with other projects. Moreover, these changes can enable young learners to collaborate with each other during program construction whether they share their physical location or study remotely. Importantly, providing access to the wider world will also help counter widespread student perceptions that block-based environments are mere toys, and show that they are capable of creating compelling applications. The paper presents NetsBlox, a programming environment that supports these ideas and shows that tools can be designed to democratize access to powerful ideas in computing.","1943-6106","978-1-6654-4592-4","10.1109/VL/HCC51201.2021.9576399","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:1835874); National Security Agency(grant numbers:H98230-18-D-0010); Computational Thinking and Learning Initiative of Vanderbilt University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9576399","","COVID-19;Visualization;Codes;Educational robots;Web services;Toy manufacturing industry;Distributed databases","","3","","26","IEEE","29 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, sensor nodes in IoT suffer from the limited lifetime of batteries resulting from their finite energy availability. A promising solution is to harvest energy from environmental sources, such as solar, kinetic, thermal, and radio-frequency (RF) waves, for perpetual and continuous operation of IoT sensor nodes. In addition to energy generation, recently energy harvesters have been used for context detection, eliminating the need for conventional activity sensors (e.g., accelerometers), saving space, cost, and energy consumption. Using energy harvesters for simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting enables energy positive sensing-an important and emerging class of sensors, which harvest more energy than required for context detection and the additional energy can be used to power other components of the system. Although simultaneous sensing and energy harvesting is an important step forward toward autonomous self-powered sensor nodes, the energy and information availability can be still intermittent, unpredictable, and temporally misaligned with various computational tasks on the sensor node. This article provides a comprehensive survey on task scheduling algorithms for the emerging class of energy harvesting-based sensors (i.e., energy positive sensors) to achieve the sustainable operation of IoT. We discuss inherent differences between conventional sensing and energy positive sensing and provide an extensive critical analysis for devising revised task scheduling algorithms incorporating this new class of sensors.

HVAC is a safety critical system which must ensure emergency ventilation in case of fire and in case of loss of primary ventilation functions. A study of the HVAC's critical areas is mandatory to optimize its reliability and availability and consequently to guarantee a low operation and maintenance cost. The first part of the paper describes the FMECA which is performed and reported to highlight the main criticalities of the HVAC system under analysis. Secondly, the paper deals with the problem of the evaluation of a threshold risk value, which can distinguish negligible and critical failure modes. Literature barely considers the problem of an objective risk threshold estimation. Therefore, a new analytical method based on finite difference is introduced to find a univocal risk threshold value. The method is then tested on two Risk Priority Number datasets related to the same HVAC. The threshold obtained in both cases is a good tradeoff between the risk mitigation and the cost investment for the corrective actions required to mitigate the risk level. Finally, the threshold obtained with the proposed method is compared with the methods available in literature. The comparison shows that the proposed finite difference method is a well-structured technique, with a low computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach provides results in line with the literature, but it completely deletes the problem of subjectivity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3088948","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9453769","Failure analysis;HVAC;railway safety;reliability;risk analysis","HVAC;Rail transportation;Ventilation;Reliability;Safety;Maintenance engineering;Standards","","14","","45","CCBY","14 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Rather than frame computing as a value-neutral tool, a justice-centered approach to equitable CS education draws on critical pedagogy to ensure the rightful presence of political struggles by emphasizing the development of not only knowledge and skills but also CS disciplinary identities. While recent efforts have integrated ethics into several areas of the undergraduate CS curriculum, critical approaches for teaching data structures and algorithms in particular are undertheorized. Basic Data Structures remains focused on runtime-centered algorithm analysis. We argue for affordance analysis, a more critical algorithm analysis based on an affordance account of value embedding. Drawing on critical methods from science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and human-computer interaction, affordance analysis examines how the design of computational abstractions such as data structures and algorithms embody affordances, which in turn embody values with political consequences. We illustrate 5 case studies of how affordance analysis refutes social determination of technology, foregrounds the limitations of data abstractions, and implicates the design of algorithms in disproportionately distributing benefits and harms to particular social identities within the matrix of domination.","","978-1-6654-4905-2","10.1109/RESPECT51740.2021.9620635","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9620635","abstractions;affordances;algorithms;critical pedagogy;computing education;data structures;design justice;ethics;political identity;rightful presence","Human computer interaction;Computer science;Ethics;Philosophical considerations;Affordances;Education;Tools","","3","","32","IEEE","30 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we conducted a three-week (six hour) virtual after-school program which introduced high school students with different programming backgrounds to coding in MYR. During the program, students learned the basics of MYR, introductory CS topics, and completed individual coding projects, creating an original MYR scene.A study examined changes in students’ spatial reasoning as a result of this intervention. The students’ performance in spatial skills was measured using the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R) [1]. Students completed this instrument using a pre/post survey design. We analyzed the impact of the intervention using a paired samples T-test. We further developed a rubric for analyzing the sophistication of students’ MYR code and applied it to evaluating the programming expertise of our study participants.The program was hosted twice with two different groups of high school students. Most showed interest in MYR programming and expressed their creativity and learned skills in their original project. With the first group of students, we found increases in their spatial visualization performance after the intervention with MYR, though statistical significance was not reached. The second group of students had higher baseline prior experience in computing and spatial visualization skills; these students did not further increase in their spatial visualization skill.The analysis showed that the MYR has a potential to improve spatial skills and engage students’ interest in computing. We recommend that MYR and related computational environments be further studied and made available to students.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962403","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962403","Computer science education;Spatial skills;Virtual reality","Visualization;Correlation;Instruments;Virtual reality;Encoding;Cognition;Programming profession","","1","","15","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this article, a robust bionic polarized skylight orientation method based on the model consistency of polarization patterns (MCOPPs) is proposed for cloudy weather. First, we made full use of the DOP information to preprocess the polarization information as an aid to the subsequent polarization light orientation. Then, based on the vertical feature of the E-vector of the polarized light and the scattering plane, we developed the MCOPP error criterion and proposed a two-step optimizing framework for the effective selection of the interior points. Finally, the outdoor static rotating experiment and the dynamic vehicle experiment are conducted for evaluating our algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that MCOPP can realize an effective and robust polarized orientation under cloudy conditions, and the accuracy of orientation in the outdoor static experiment is within 0.5° and in the dynamic car experiment is within 0.7°. Compared with the other four classic methods, the RMSE of the orientation error can be decreased by 50.6% in the outdoor static experiment and by 46.0% in the dynamic vehicle experiment.

Using these approaches, young students can easily experience big data and artificial intelligence through a drag-and-drop approach. However, it remains difficult for them to perform more complex tasks, such as directly collecting data from the web or exploiting custom-made machine learning algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel Scratch extension that allows Scratch to communicate with text-based programming languages such as Python and JavaScript using WebSockets. Unlike other Scratch extensions, our extension greatly enhances the extensibility of Scratch given its use of “text-based visual blocks” so that messages can be freely exchanged through a minimum number of blocks. In order for students to use these blocks easily, the blocks are designed such that they can be used as if talking with a friend named “Tooee.” In order to show how this extension can help students create big data and artificial intelligence programs, we present eight example applications that students can easily implement. These are (1) Weather Forecast, (2) Top 5 Movies in Theaters, (3) COVID-19 Dashboard, (4) Saving Quiz Results to a CSV File, (5) Facial Image Classification, (6) Color Classification, (7) Object Classification, and (8) Handwriting Recognition.

Different image steganography research methods are proposed recently but each has their advantages and disadvantages and still have necessity to develop some better image steganography mechanisms to achieve the reliability between the basics criteria of image steganography. Therefore, the proposed work, in this paper, is based on the Least Significant Bit (LSB) substitution method. The LSB substitution method can minimize the error rate in embedding process and can achieve greater reliability in criteria, using novel algorithm based on value difference. In this paper, we proposed a novel technique in steganography within the digital images such is RGB, Gray Scale, Texture, Aerial images to achieve higher security, imperceptibility, capacity, and robustness as compared with existing methods. The experimental outcomes of the suggested approach prove further developed strength and justify the feasibility of our research. Through numerical simulations, we observed that the proposed strategy outperformed the next-best current methodology by 5.561 percent in terms of PSNR Correlation score. Additionally, the proposed approach achieved a 6.43 percent better score in PSNR with a variable measure of code inserted in similar images with distinct dimensions. Furthermore, encrypting the same amount of information in images of varying sizes resulted in approximately 6.77 percent improvements. Embedding different sizes of a particular secret message in a different image (such as Gray, Texture, Aerial and RGB images) came out with about 5.466 percent of better score.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3224745","Qatar National Library; Qurtuba University of Science and Technology, Peshawar, Pakistan; Qatar University(grant numbers:IRCC-2021-010); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9963925","Image steganography;LSB;image quality assessment metrics;histogram analysis;image;capacity;robustness","Steganography;Data privacy;Error analysis;Digital images;Current measurement;Numerical simulation;Robustness","","11","","35","CCBY","24 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To this end, we analyze how different students interact with a gamified course. We devised such an experimental course on Multimedia Content Production (MCP), and ran it for ten years. At each year, we modified it after students' feedback from the previous year. We determined student groups applying clustering techniques to learner performance data, independently analyzed the resulting clusters in terms of behavior, engagement, performance, and also compared those pairwise. Our analysis identified four different student groups (profiles/clusters) according to their performance and interactions with the course across all years. We found out that the best performing students were those that had significantly more interactions with course materials and consistently ranked highest. In addition, we found that performance indicators for students of all groups became stable within the first month after course start, allowing final grades to be predicted with high accuracy by then. Furthermore, all were deadline driven and became mainly active at the end of the semesters (indicating a lack of self-regulation skills).

We develop a Causal Bayesian Networks model based on causal science using  $d$ -separation and do-operations to discover the causal graph aligned with cognitive understanding. Causal odd ratios are used to measure the causal assumptions integrated with the real-world data to prove the proposed causal model compatibility. Causal effect relationships in the model are verified based on causal P-values and causal confident intervals and approved less than 1% by random chance. It shows that the causal model can encode cognitive understanding as precise, robust relationships.

In this perspective paper, a new STrategic ROadMap, aiSTROM, is presented that empowers managers to create an AI strategy. A comprehensive approach is provided that guides managers and lead developers through the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, the top  $n$  potential projects (typically 3-5) are first identified. For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other considerations include AI as a service (AIaas) and outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies, one has to consider challenges such as bias, the legality of black-box models, and keeping humans in the loop. Next, like any project, value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) need to be defined to track and validate the progress. Depending on the company’s risk strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects. Finally, one should make sure that the strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable a culture of adoption.

Filled pauses are very frequent in spontaneous speech. Their detection is therefore rather important for two basic reasons: (a) their existence influences the performance of individual components, like Automatic Speech Recognition system (ASR), in human-machine interaction and (b) their frequency can characterize the overall speech quality of a particular speaker, as it can be strongly associated with the speaker's confidence. Despite that, only limited work has been published for the detection of filled pauses in speech, especially through audio. In this work, we propose a framework for filled pause detection using both audio and textual information. For the audio modality, we transfer knowledge from a plethora of supervised tasks, such as emotion or speaking rate, using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). For the text modality, we develop a temporal Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) method that takes into account textual information derived from an ASR system. In addition, the proposed transfer learning approach for the audio classifier leads to better results when benchmarked on our internal dataset for which the text is not transcribed but estimated by an ASR system. In this case, a simple late fusion approach boosts the performance even further. This proves that the audio approach is suitable for real-world applications where the transcribed text is not available and has to leverage imperfect ASR results, or even the absence of textual information (to reduce computational cost).","2156-8111","978-1-6654-5908-2","10.1109/ACII55700.2022.9953889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9953889","Filled Pauses;Hesitation;Disfluency Detection;Audio Classification;Text Classification;Multimodal Learning;Automatic Speech Recognition;Convolutional Neural Networks;Recurrent Neural Networks;Deep Learning","Knowledge engineering;Affective computing;Recurrent neural networks;Transfer learning;Benchmark testing;Computational efficiency;Convolutional neural networks","","2","","35","IEEE","25 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A common single nucleotide polymorphism in the human BDNF gene (Val66Met) impairs activity-dependent secretion of the BDNF, and carrying Met allele is associated with poorer learning. We explored the role of BDNF polymorphism in short-term plasticity induced by complex cognitive stimulation with creativity thinking tasks in Caucasian adults from younger (22.7±3.7 years old, N = 63) and older (63.5±5.2 years old, N = 49) age groups. Resting-state EEG with eyes open was recorded prior to and immediately after forty-minute verbal and figural creative task performance. The EEG spectral density in individual alpha frequency band was calculated using FFT in pre-task and post-task intervals. All subjects were genotyped for BDNF status. ANOVA revealed more left-sided (left>right) changes from pre-task to post-task intervals in Val/Val homozygotes in comparison with Met carriers. BDNF-associated alpha power asymmetry indicator in frontal region, which is well-known manifestation of motivational withdrawal/approach, was strongly correlated with interest in tasks (not with originality, amount of ideas, or task difficulty). Mediation analysis confirmed that attenuated frontal asymmetry (left-right) of pre/post task changes in Met carriers in comparison to Val/Val was associated with lower interest in tasks - component of internal motivation for creative problem solving. These findings suggest that complex cognitive stimulation with creativity tasks induced tendency towards withdrawal motivation in Met carriers in comparison to Val/Val at the level of brain activity.","","978-1-6654-5288-5","10.1109/CSGB56354.2022.9865351","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9865351","brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF);BDNF Val66Met polymorphism;short-term plasticity;alpha power;hemispheric asymmetry;withdrawal/approach","Brain;Genomics;Electroencephalography;Task analysis;Mediation;Bioinformatics;Creativity","","","","27","IEEE","31 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To harness quantum computers’ real potential in software applications, one needs to have an in-depth understanding of all such characteristics of quantum computing platforms (QCPs), relevant from the Software Engineering (SE) perspective. Restrictions on copying, deletion, the transmission of qubit states, a hard dependency on quantum algorithms are few, out of many, examples of QCP characteristics that have significant implications for building quantum software.Thus, developing quantum software requires a paradigm shift in thinking by software engineers. This paper presents the key findings from the SE perspective, resulting from an in-depth examination of state-of-the-art QCPs available today. The main contributions that we present include i) Proposing a general architecture of the QCPs, ii) Proposing a programming model for developing quantum software, iii) Determining architecturally significant characteristics of QCPs, and iv) Determining the impact of these characteristics on various Quality Attributes (QAs) and Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) activities.We show that the nature of QCPs makes them useful mainly in specialized application areas such as scientific computing. Except for performance and scalability, most of the other QAs (e.g., maintainability, testability, and reliability) are adversely affected by different characteristics of a QCP.","","978-1-7281-6260-7","10.1109/ICSA51549.2021.00016","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9426783","Quantum Computing;Quantum Software Engineering;Software Development Life Cycle;Computing Platforms","Quantum algorithm;Software architecture;Scalability;Qubit;Buildings;Software algorithms;Computer architecture","","7","","68","IEEE","11 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various threats have been presented, including black-box attacks, where malicious participants can recover arbitrary inputs fed into their devices. Although many countermeasures were designed to achieve privacy-preserving DNN, most of them result in additional computation and lower accuracy. In this paper, we present an approach that targets the security of collaborative deep inference via re-thinking the distribution strategy, without sacrificing the model performance. Particularly, we examine different DNN partitions that make the model susceptible to black-box threats and we derive the amount of data that should be allocated per device to hide proprieties of the original input. We formulate this methodology, as an optimization, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference and the privacy-level of data.

This new venture will require professionals in both software engineering and services computing to collaborate with an unprecedented intensity, and jointly develop the new interdisciplinary field hereby named Software Services Engineering (SSE). In SSE, the ever-deepening system dynamics emerging from both environments and humans in varying contexts are imposing steep challenges to both researchers and practitioners. Humans, both developers and the vast number of end users, are embedded ever closer to IoT environments, and are being afforded ample opportunities to continuously inject inputs during system development and after deployment. In fact, humans are increasingly playing the roles of both sensor and actuator. Traditional requirements engineering researchers are being lured more than ever into exploiting the IoT environments where human users are deeply embedded, to gather contextual information that inevitably introduces lots of ambiguity and uncertainty. Provisioning of highly adaptable and scalable microservices would be key to timely meeting ever-changing human desires and ever-evolving system requirements in the nimblest manner. As such, an ultra-agile and field-programmable development methodology and environment will be imperative to achieving such ultrafine grained microservices provisioning. Such ultra-agility and ultrafine granularity requirements imposed to the services industry obligate company executives to expect extreme manageability assurance to become the centroid of system operations and administration. The ultimate goal in pursuit of such a noble dream will be to provide genuinely individualized and trustworthy service, possibly enabled by AI, but it should be both explainable and ethical. Facing such grand challenges, this declaration samples a subset of burning issues in SSE through observations in seven themes, only meant to be starting points for the SSE community to further investigate. Through our declarations we also call for heightened attention to an assorted array of existing, barely emerging or non-existent services computing and software engineering methods for a concerted effort to research and explore.","","978-1-6654-1681-8","10.1109/ICWS53863.2021.00014","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9590227","agile;AI;context-aware;DevOps;IoT;microservice;ML;requirements engineering;services computing;situation-aware;software engineering;software services engineering;uncertainty","Industries;Ethics;Uncertainty;Web services;System dynamics;Systems operation;Service computing","","5","","53","IEEE","11 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Why is bitcoin using so much energy? Most of the energy is used during the bitcoin mining process, which serves at least two significant purposes: a) distributing new cryptocurrency coins to the cryptoeconomy and b) securing the Bitcoin blockchain ledger. In reality, the comparison of bitcoin transactions to Visa transactions is not that simple. The amount of transactions in the Bitcoin network is not directly connected to the amount of bitcoin mining power nor the energy consumption of those mining devices; for example, it is possible to multiply the number of bitcoin transactions per second without increasing the mining power and the energy consumption. Bitcoin is not only “digital money for hackers”. It has very promising future potential as a global reserve currency and a method to make the World Wide Web (WWW) immune to cyberattacks such as the Distributed Denial-of-Service attacks. This survey approached cryptocurrencies’ various technological and environmental issues from many different perspectives. To make various cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin (BTC) and ether (ETH), greener and more justified, what technological solutions do we have? We found that cryptocurrency mining might be cleaner than is generally expected. There is also a plan to make a vast renewable energy source available by combining Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion and Bitcoin mining. There are plans to use unconventional computing methods (quantum computing, reversible computing, ternary computing, optical computing, analog computing) to solve some of the issues regarding the vast energy consumption of conventional computing (including cryptocurrency mining). We think using spare computing cycles for grid computing efforts is justified. For example, there are billions of smartphones in the world. Many smartphones are being recharged every day. If this daily recharging period of twenty to sixty minutes would be used for grid computing, for example, finding new cures to cancer, it would probably be a significant breakthrough for medical research simulations. We call on the cryptocurrency communities to research and develop grid computing and unconventional computing methods for the most significant cryptocurrencies: bitcoin (BTC)and ether (ETH).","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3190891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9829550","Blockchain;DLT;cryptocurrency;bitcoin;green technology;sustainability;unconventional computing;climate change","Bitcoin;Blockchains;Green products;Energy consumption;Air pollution;Peer-to-peer computing;Grid computing","","4","","152","CCBY","14 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this work, we propose a novel analog CIM technique for GEMM using 3D NOR Flash devices to support general-purpose matrix multiplication. Our analysis indicates that it’s very robust to use “billions” of memory cells with modest 4-level and large-spacing analog Icell to produce good accuracy and reliability, contrary to the past thinking to pursue many levels in each memory cell that inevitably suffers accuracy loss. We estimate that a 2.7Gb 3D NOR GEMM can provide a high-performance (frame/sec>300) image recognition inference of ResNet-50 on ImageNet dataset, using a simple flexible controller chip with 1MB SRAM without the need of massive ALU and external DRAM. The accuracy can maintain ~85% for Cifar-10 (by VGG7), and ~90% for ImageNet Top-5 (by ResNet-50) under good device control. This 3D NOR GEMM enjoys much lower system cost and flexibility than a complicated SOC. We also propose an operation and design method of “Cosine Similarity” computing using the 3D NOR. We can use a ternary similarity search algorithm with positive and negative inputs and weights to perform high-dimension feature vector (such as 512 for face recognition with FaceNet on VGGFace2 dataset) similarity computing in a high-parallelism CIM design (512 WL inputs, 1024 BL’s, at Tread=100ns). High-accuracy search (~97.8%, almost identical to 98% of software computing) and high internal search bandwidth (~5Tb/s per chip) are achieved. This in-Flash search accelerator is potential to enable new hardware-aware search algorithms in big data retrieval applications.","2156-017X","978-1-6654-8959-1","10.1109/IEDM45625.2022.10019495","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10019495","","Performance evaluation;Three-dimensional displays;Software algorithms;Neural networks;Memory architecture;Random access memory;Common Information Model (computing)","","3","","6","IEEE","23 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The choice of feature is critical for face recognition. The different features of the sample contribute differently to face recognition. The joint similar and specific learning (JSSL) has been effectively applied in multi-feature face recognition. In the JSSL, although the representation coefficient is divided into the similar coefficient and the specific coefficient, there is the disadvantage that the training images cannot represent the testing images well, because there are probable expressions, illuminations and disguises in the testing images. We think that the intra-class variations of one person can be linearly represented by those of other people. In order to solve well the disadvantage of JSSL, in the paper, we extend JSSL and propose the extended joint similar and specific learning (EJSSL) for multi-feature face recognition. EJSSL constructs the intra-class variant dictionary to represent the probable variation between the training images and the testing images. EJSSL uses the training images and the intra-class variant dictionary to effectively represent the testing images. The proposed EJSSL method is perfectly experimented on some available face databases, and its performance is superior to many current face recognition methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3089836","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11705122); Scientific Research Foundation of Sichuan University of Science and Engineering(grant numbers:2019RC11,2019RC12); Sichuan Science and Technology Program of China(grant numbers:2019YJ0477,2020YFSY0027,2020YFH0124); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2021A1515011342); Open Foundation of Artificial Intelligence Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province(grant numbers:2019RZJ03,2020RZY02); Applied Basic Research Programs of Science and Technology Department of Zigong(grant numbers:2019YYJC29,2020YGJC01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9456884","Sparse representation;image classification;multi-feature;face recognition","Face recognition;Feature extraction;Training;Testing;Dictionaries;Data mining;Collaboration","","","","49","CCBY","16 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We view engineering judgment as an embodied process that emerges through discourse as individuals position themselves relative to both other individuals and disciplinary norms in a range of contexts. It happens, broadly, through a series of tasks and thinking processes through which students choose and formulate problems, make assumptions, select data, and adopt roles in relation to disciplinary norms in different contexts. We explore this conceptualization of engineering judgment using thematic and dramaturgical analysis of a single case. The data collected are a semi-structured 90-minute interview collected with one systems engineering senior after completion of their senior project and graduation from their degree program. These data are first coded using a thematic analysis approach, then re-analyzed using a dramaturgical approach. Our findings raise important issues about the blend of communication demands faced by practicing engineers that potentially impact the socialization of engineering students. Different communication demands require students to use different ways to navigate complexity. The varied communication forms also prompt students to view themselves as professionals with the capacity to judge and act from a position of professional authority that vary with the situational context.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-3851-3","10.1109/FIE49875.2021.9637349","National Science Foundation (NSF)(grant numbers:1927035,1927096); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9637349","engineering judgment;engineering identity;thematic analysis;dramaturgical analysis","Navigation;Conferences;Writing;Complexity theory;Task analysis;Interviews;Engineering students","","","","19","IEEE","20 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These pattern sequences include a gamma waves that indicates deep thinking behaviour, a beta wave sequence that indicates busy and active mind status, an alpha wave segment which indicates reflective and restful behaviour, a theta wave which is an indicative of drowsiness, and a delta wave which indicates sleeping & dreaming conditions. Features like frequency changes, amplitude changes, pattern changes, etc. are used to identify chronic, ischemic and other diseases related to the brain. In order to classify these wave patterns into brain diseases like epilepsy, a series of high complexity signal processing operations are needed to be executed in tandem. These operations include signal pre-processing, feature extraction, feature selection, classification into epileptic & non-epileptic seizure and post-processing. A large variety of algorithms are developed by researchers for each of these operations. Performance of these algorithms varies largely w.r.t. the number of leads used for EEG capture, filtering efficiency, feature extraction & selection efficiency, and classifier efficiency. Thus, it becomes ambiguous for researchers and system designers to select the best possible algorithm set for their application. In order to reduce the ambiguity, this text provides a comprehensive comparison of a wide variety of epileptic & non-epileptic seizure classification system models. These models are statistically compared on the basis of overall accuracy, delay of decision making, precision, recall, f-measure and field of application. It is observed that convolutional neural network (CNN) based models outperform other models in terms of general-purpose performance, while specialized CNN models must be used for application specific deployments.","","978-1-6654-0073-2","10.1109/ESCI53509.2022.9758337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9758337","EEG;classification;deep learning;convolutional;neural;network;epileptic & non-epileptic seizure","Support vector machines;Transfer learning;Signal processing algorithms;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Electroencephalography;Real-time systems","","","","24","IEEE","22 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately the uncertainties due to COVID-19 affected the number of proposed events during the HTD. Still, the 2021 HTD will welcome the following very interesting special session ""Self-Adaptive Safety- and Mission-critical CPS: Wishful Thinking or Absolute Necessity?"" Due to the increasing performance demands of mission- and safety-critical Cyber Physical Systems (CPS), these systems exhibit a rapidly growing complexity, manifested by an increasing number of (distributed) computational cores and application components connected via complex networks. However, with the growing complexity and interconnectivity of these systems, the chances of hardware failures as well as disruptions due to cyber-attacks will also quickly increase. System adaptivity, for example in the form of dynamically remapping of application components to processing cores, represents a promising technique to handle this challenging scenario. In this session, we address the (consequences of the) idea of deploying runtime adaptivity to mission and safety-critical CPS, yielding dynamically morphing systems, to establish robustness against computational hurdles, component failures, and cyberattacks.

From the perspective of class space on base set, existing methods either focus on utilizing all classes under a global view by normal pretraining, or pay more attention to adopt an episodic manner to train meta-tasks within few classes in a local view. However, the interaction of the two views is rarely explored. As the two views capture complementary information, we naturally think of the compatibility of them for achieving further performance gains. Inspired by the mutual learning paradigm and binocular parallax, we propose a unified framework, namely Binocular Mutual Learning (BML), which achieves the compatibility of the global view and the local view through both intraview and cross-view modeling. Concretely, the global view learns in the whole class space to capture rich inter-class relationships. Meanwhile, the local view learns in the local class space within each episode, focusing on matching positive pairs correctly. In addition, cross-view mutual interaction further promotes the collaborative learning and the implicit exploration of useful knowledge from each other. During meta-test, binocular embeddings are aggregated together to support decision-making, which greatly improve the accuracy of classification.

Recent works have observed that CNN-generated images share a systematic shortcoming in replicating high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. Furthermore, these works have successfully exploited this systematic shortcoming to detect CNN-generated images reporting up to 99% accuracy across multiple state-of-the-art GAN models.In this work, we investigate the validity of assertions claiming that CNN-generated images are unable to achieve high frequency spectral decay consistency. We meticulously construct a counterexample space of high frequency spectral decay consistent CNN-generated images emerging from our handcrafted experiments using DCGAN, LSGAN, WGAN-GP and StarGAN, where we empirically show that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by a minor architecture change in the last upsampling operation. We subsequently use images from this counterexample space to successfully bypass the recently proposed forensics detector which leverages on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes for CNN-generated image detection.Through this study, we show that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay discrepancies are not inherent characteristics for existing CNN-based generative models—contrary to the belief of some existing work—, and such features are not robust to perform synthetic image detection.

The objective is to minimize a global function that is a sum of the agents’ local loss functions. And the optimization is conducted by analog over-the-air model training. Specifically, each agent modulates its local gradient onto a set of waveforms and transmits to the edge server simultaneously. From the received analog signal the edge server extracts a noisy aggregated gradient which is distorted by the channel fading and interference, and uses it to update the global model and feedbacks to all the agents for another round of local computing. Since the electromagnetic interference generally exhibits a heavy-tailed intrinsic, we use the $\alpha$-stable distribution to model its statistic. In consequence, the global gradient has an infinite variance that hinders the use of conventional techniques for convergence analysis that rely on second-order moments’ existence. To circumvent this challenge, we take a new route to establish the analysis of convergence rate, as well as generalization error, of the algorithm. We also show that the training algorithm can be run in tandem with the momentum scheme to accelerate the convergence. Our analyses reveal a two-sided effect of the interference on the overall training procedure. On the negative side, heavy tail noise slows down the convergence rate of the model training: the heavier the tail in the distribution of interference, the slower the algorithm converges. On the positive side, heavy tail noise has the potential to increase the generalization power of the trained model: the heavier the tail, the better the model generalizes. This perhaps counterintuitive conclusion implies that the prevailing thinking on interference – that it is only detrimental to the edge learning system – is outdated and we shall seek new techniques that exploit, rather than simply mitigate, the interference for better machine learning in wireless networks.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3139231","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LGJ22F010001); Zhejiang University/University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Institute Starting Fund; ZJU-UIUC Joint Research Center Project(grant numbers:DREMES 202003); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-1908308); National Research Foundation; Info-communications Media Development Authority; Future Communications Research & Development Programme; MOE ARF Tier 2(grant numbers:T2EP20120-0006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9666041","Distributed machine learning;analog over-the-air computing;heavy-tailed interference;convergence rate;generalization error","Servers;Interference;Training;Convergence;Computational modeling;Machine learning;Fading channels","","17","","34","IEEE","30 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But ensemble learning techniques have not been explored much to predict future stock price. So, the present study stresses comparing statistical methods with ensemble learning methods. This paper compares the ARIMA, Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting models based on root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). The subject chosen is Google’s stocks, and the data used is from NASDAQ stock exchange. The analysis results show that the ARIMA model performed fairly well for short-term predictions but relatively high MAPE value. The extreme gradient boosting model gave the best performance with the lowest RMSE and MAPE value.

Schizophrenia (Sz) is a brain disorder that severely affects the thinking, behavior, and feelings of people worldwide. Thus, an accurate and rapid detection method is needed for proper care and quality treatment of the patients. Electroencephalography (EEG) is proved to be an efficient biomarker in Sz detection as it records brain activities. This article aims to improve the performance of EEG-based Sz detection using a deep-learning approach in remote applications. A hybrid deep-learning model identified as schizophrenia hybrid neural network (SzHNN), which is a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM), has been proposed wherein the CNN for local feature extraction and LSTM for classification is utilized. In this article, the proposed model has been compared with several deep-learning and machine-learning-based models. All the models have been evaluated on two different datasets wherein dataset 1 consists of 19 subjects and dataset 2 consists of 16 subjects. The proposed model is also implemented with the Internet-of-Medical-Things (IoMT) framework for smart healthcare and remote-based applications. Several experiments have been conducted using various parametric settings on different frequency bands and different sets of electrodes on the scalp. Based on all the experiments, it is evident that the proposed hybrid model (SzHNN) provides the highest classification accuracy of 99.9% compared to other implemented models and existing models of previous papers. The proposed model overcomes the influence of different frequency bands and shows a better accuracy of 96.10% (dataset 1) and 91.00% (dataset 2) with only five electrodes. Subject-wise testing is also done for SzHNN, which proposes an accuracy of 90.11% and 89.60% for datasets 1 and 2, respectively.","1557-9662","","10.1109/TIM.2022.3212040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9911763","Abnormal brain activity;electroencephalography (EEG);hybrid neural network;Internet of Medical Things (IoMT);schizophrenia (Sz)","Electroencephalography;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Medical services","","13","","32","IEEE","5 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"II-20: Intelligent and pragmatic analytic categorization of image collections","J. Zahálka; M. Worring; J. J. Van Wijk","Czech Technical University, Prague; University of Amsterdam; Eindhoven University of Technology",IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,"28 Jan 2021","2021","27","2","422","431","In this paper, we introduce 11–20 (Image Insight 2020), a multimedia analytics approach for analytic categorization of image collections. Advanced visualizations for image collections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to support the task of analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and interactive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic categorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between the two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories of relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is rigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that truly brings the user to insight requires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the exploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions: a human thinks about image data mostly in semantic terms. 11–20 brings three major contributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing the pragmatic gap. Firstly, a new machine model that closely follows the user's interactions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's machine model, in addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art's ability to produce relevant suggestions, allows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without any additional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris metaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows a well-trained model to analyze the collection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the classic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user to harness the model to quickly expand (“fast-forward”) the categories of relevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary. Automated experiments show that II-20's machine model outperforms the existing state of the art and also demonstrate the Tetris metaphor's analytic quality. User studies further confirm that II–20 is an intuitive, efficient, and effective multimedia analytics tool.","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030383","European Regional Development Fund(grant numbers:CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15003/0000470); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9230430","Multimedia analytics;image data;analytic categorization;pragmatic gap","Analytical models;Semantics;Pragmatics;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Visual analytics","","8","","48","IEEE","19 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, recent studies show that DNNs are vulnerable in defending adversarial examples. The classification network can be deceived by adding a small amount of perturbation to clean samples. There are challenges when researchers want to design a general approach to defend against a wide variety of adversarial examples. To solve this problem, we introduce a defensive method to prevent adversarial examples from generating. Instead of designing a stronger classifier, we built a more robust classification system that can be viewed as a structural black box. After adding a buffer to the classification system, attackers can be efficiently deceived. The real evaluation results of the generated adversarial examples are often contrary to what the attacker thinks. Additionally, we do not assume a specific attack method premise. This incognizance to underlying attacks demonstrates the generalizability of the buffer to potential adversarial attacks.

The proposed model detects the intrusion types currently in the network by using deep learning ANN and stack ensemble techniques. There is no space for compromise in security so it is strongly recommended to use an intrusion detection system that is more accurate and efficient.

Secondly, the economic, environmental and energy-saving benefits of each operating equipment are quantified by Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Therefore, the scheduling value of the device is comprehensively assessed according to the specific scenario. Finally, decomposing the output of the device into direct available energy and indirect available energy, an optimal model is built with the maximum general production benefits as the objective, and is solved by MATLAB and CPLEX.

Therefore, in this article, we are the first to propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) method that optimizes the application execution quality of energy harvesting edge devices to mitigate the variations. First, we propose a baseline DRL formulation that novelly migrates the objective of quality maximization into a reward function and constructs a DRL quality agent. Second, we devise a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based selector that performs DRL quality agent selection based on the energy harvesting history. Third, we further propose two optimization methods to alleviate the nonnegligible overhead of DRL computations: 1) an improved thinking-while-moving concurrent DRL scheme to compromise the “state drifting” issue during the DRL decision process and 2) a variable interstate duration decision scheme that compromises the DVFS overhead incurred in each action taken. The experiments take an adaptive stereo matching application as a case study. The results show that the proposed DRL-based DVFS method on average achieves 17.9% runtime reduction and 22.05% quality improvement compared to state-of-the-art solutions.","1937-4151","","10.1109/TCAD.2022.3142188","Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62074101,62150710549); Shanghai Science and Technology Commission Funding(grant numbers:19511131200,20ZR1435800); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72071116); Ningbo Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:2019B10026,2017D10034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9677006","Adaptive application;deep reinforcement learning (DRL);energy harvesting;quality optimization;stereo matching","Adaptation models;Energy harvesting;Uncertainty;Optimization;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Runtime","","5","","44","IEEE","11 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Programming assignments usually contain algorithmic implementations written in specific programming languages to assess students' logical thinking and problem-solving skills. Evaluators use either a test case-driven or source code analysis approach when evaluating programming assignments. Given that many marking rubrics and evaluation criteria provide partial marks for programs that are not syntactically correct, evaluators are required to analyze the source code during evaluations. This extra step adds additional burden on evaluators that consumes more time and effort. Hence, this research work attempts to study existing automatic source code analysis mechanisms, specifically, use of deep learning approaches in the domain of automatic assessments.

It is the most common kind of dementia. It is a syndrome that begins with modest memory loss and gradually deteriorates your thinking abilities, occasions, and ability to execute day-to-day routine tasks. It affects the areas of the brain that govern cognition, memory, and language. It has the potential to have a significant influence on a person's ability to carry out everyday responsibility. Because no drug or cure has yet been discovered, it is critical to forecast it at an early stage. The prediction of Alzheimer's disease is done manually by evaluating MRI scans; nevertheless, the risks of human mistake are quite high with this method. The purpose of this research is to improve prediction accuracy in order to detect AZM at an early stage and prevent the patient from progressing to a severe state of the disease. In this research, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Softmax classifier (i.e., CNN+Softmax) has been used to identify and categories the AZM MRI into four distinct classes, namely mild demented (MD), moderate demented (MOD), non-demented (ND), very mild demented (VMD). The proposed CNN+Softmax model is then compared by replacing the dense layer of CNN to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, i.e., CNN+SVM and the work is calculated on the various grids which includes accuracy, precision, recall and f1-score. On test data, the presented approach surmounted the CNN+SVM model with a classification accuracy of 98.59 percent.","","978-1-6654-1005-2","10.1109/ICICICT54557.2022.9917774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9917774","Alzheimer;Support Vector Machine;Convolutional Neural Network;Deep Learning;MRI","Training;Magnetic resonance imaging;Computational modeling;Support vector machine classification;Feature extraction;Data models;Convolutional neural networks","","4","","18","IEEE","18 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our hypothesis is that the PFC detects the hierarchical structure in temporal sequences in the shape of ordinal patterns and uses them to index information hierarchically in different parts of the brain. Henceforth, we propose that this mechanism for detecting ordinal patterns participates also in the hierarchical organization of the brain during development; i.e., the bootstrapping of the connectome. By doing so, it gives the tools to the language-ready brain for manipulating abstract knowledge and for planning temporally ordered information; i.e., the emergence of causality and symbolic thinking.

In audio applications, magnitude of time-frequency representation, including spectrogram, is regarded as one of the most important features. Such magnitude-based features have been extensively utilized in learning-based audio processing. Since a logarithmic scale is important in terms of auditory perception, the features are usually computed with a logarithmic function. That is, a logarithmic function is applied within the computation of features so that a learning machine does not have to explicitly model the logarithmic scale. We think in a different way and propose a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) that simultaneously models linear- and log-magnitude spectra. RBM is a stochastic neural network that can discover data representations without supervision. To manage both linear and logarithmic scales, we define an energy function based on both scales. This energy function results in a conditional distribution (of the observable data, given hidden units) that is written as the gamma distribution, and hence the proposed RBM is termed gamma-Bernoulli RBM. The proposed gamma-Bernoulli RBM was compared to the ordinary Gaussian-Bernoulli RBM by speech representation experiments.

Nevertheless, confidential computing is even more complex to implement than Zero-Trust. In this work, we combine the Zero-Trust model with confidential computing by leveraging the SPIFFE standard through its reference implementation (SPIRE), and Intel SGX through the SCONE framework, to seamlessly supply software identities to confidential microservices. Furthermore, we also protected the whole identity-provisioning stack with Intel SGX and assessed the performance overhead.

Dementia, which gradually damages brain cells, is the primary cause of AD. People with this disease lose their ability to think, read, and do a variety of other things. A machine learning system can help to alleviate this problem by predicting the disease. The primary goal is to detect dementia in a wide range of patients. The classification of speech signal into various categories such as audio, non- audio is an very significant front-end problem in AD prediction. There are many features have been presented for AD prediction. Unfortunately, these characteristics are not mutually exclusive, and combining them has no effect on AD prediction performance. By removing these redundant and irrelevant features, Feature Selection (FS) provides a simple yet effective solution to this problem. Removing irrelevant data improves learning accuracy, decreases computation time, and allows for a more thorough understanding of the learning model or data. The proposed model in this paper is a hybrid machine learning model in which we used an FS approach based on Mutual Information (MI). MLP is used for classification and MFCC is used to extract all of the features from the ADReSSo dataset. In terms of accuracy, our experimental results show that the proposed classifier outperforms existing classifiers.","","978-1-6654-3789-9","10.1109/ICACITE53722.2022.9823665","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9823665","Cognitive impairment Detection;perceptual Computing;Alzheimer's dementia;Algorithmic Paralinguistics","Computational modeling;Semantics;Machine learning;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Data models","","2","","26","IEEE","18 Jul 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A two-stage association analysis was designed and conducted on a dataset collected from IT major students who enrolled in the Introduction to Computer Programming course. The first stage of association rules is to analyze and discover important relationships amongst learning styles, students' attribute, and learning performance. The second stage of moderation analysis is then applied to probe the moderation effect of the different learning preferences on the relationship between student attributes and learning achievement. Experiments expose many insights, for example, mathematics and logical thinking are powerful assets of success in computer programming study. Association rules can effectively identify associations of learning styles and the learning performance in terms of knowledge or skills. By moderation analysis, students in the “Excellent” cluster have a broad learning style than other students.

Analysis of observational data during human conversations can help inform the development of eye gaze models for digital humans. This study aimed to identify the eye gaze patterns of women dyads during a rapport-building conversation, and to evaluate the effect of different gaze patterns on rapport, trust, and psychological outcomes. 36 adult women (18 dyads) completed the Relationship Closeness Induction Task while wearing eye tracking glasses. Subjective rapport, trust, and psychological measures were collected. Gaze patterns of women were found to change as the conversation content became more intimate; specifically, gaze aversions for thinking (p=.042), turn-taking (p=.025), and intimacy modulation increased in duration (p=.012). Furthermore, gaze patterns were associated with perceptions of the conversation partner. Displaying fewer cognitive gaze aversions was associated with greater closeness (p=.029) and trust perceptions (p=.035). Longer periods of direct gaze while speaking was associated with greater rapport (p=.040). Results will inform the development of a humanlike gaze model for female digital humans during intimate conversations and may be applicable to social robots.","","978-1-6654-0731-1","10.1109/HRI53351.2022.9889336","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9889336","Digital human;conversational agent;eye gaze;rapport;trust;stress;intimacy;social support","Analytical models;Computational modeling;Social robots;Psychology;Modulation;Oral communication;Glass","","1","","50","IEEE","29 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, some factors directly relate to algal growth, including hydrodynamics, weather and ecology, are notoriously difficult to model and predict. In this paper we present a study to model algal bloom using deep learning methods. It is assumed that algal bloom is the consequence of all factors that are more or less associated with the growth of algal. This offers a new way of thinking that even unknown factors or those factors far too complicated to model can still be inexplicitly represented by the deep learning models. We evaluate this new approach through our studies of algal bloom in the JinJi Lake, Suzhou, China. The experimental results are compared with the popular machine learning methods used in literature.

One of the grand visions was to make the computer “invisible,” as framed by Weiser. But it seems like instead of computing becoming more invisible, it is taking up more of the user’s attention. In this article, I argue that this is because (pervasive) computing has only come halfway. Much effort has been done in terms of sensing and understanding the world around the user, while much less effort has been put into helping the user actually doing anything.

CNN overlooks the coherent semantic information between words despite its ability to separate nearby information between successive articulations of a sentence. Many of the current sentiment analysis methods are seeking to extract the complicated semantic also, linguistic data from the message, however they are not especially applicable to the examination of understudy opinions. For the study of student message sentiment, the CNN-BiGRU-AT model—often referred to as a novel convolutional neural network with the bidirectional gated recurrent unit and an attention mechanism—is developed. The removal of n-gram information from each sentence is subsequently accomplished using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The sentences are then consecutively condensed through the bidirectional gated intermittent unit to dispose of the message's significant semantic data parts (BiGRU). The CNN-BiGRU model is then given a thinking mechanism, and by including the attention score, different learning loads are introduced to the model. The disclosures display that its structure's accuracy rate and audit rate dependably outperform 0.9, and the F1 regard isn't lower than 0.8.

We collect and analyze I/O traces of applications on a production supercomputer and reconfirm that I/O bursts exist in most applications. What's more, we find that the I/O bursts not only occur in short periods of time but also originate from a minority of adjacent compute nodes allocated to the applications, which we call spatiotemporal I/O burstiness. The concentration of I/O traffic in both time and space dimension will make applications experience poor I/O performance and incur I/O inefficiency of the storage system. Although there are some solutions, such as burst buffer, can help alleviate such inefficiency, there is still no work that measures, analyzes and further predicts the application I/O characteristic in terms of spatiotemporal burstiness, which we think is vital for application-aware optimizations, including but not limited to burst buffer allocation and job scheduling. In this paper, we first propose a mathematical model to measure the spatiotemporal I/O burstiness. Then a thorough analysis on the spatiotemporal I/O characteristic of all applications on the system is elaborated. We further make use of the job's submitting path to explore the I/O characteristic similarity among jobs, based on which a machine learning classification algorithm is proposed to accurately predict the job spatiotemporal I/O burstiness in advance.

Criminals pose a significant threat to safety since they are continually thinking up new methods to commit these types of fraud. Early detection of fraudulent behavior is therefore vital to retain customer trust and defend the firm. Since lawful transactions far outnumber fraudulent transactions, which typically make up less than 1% of all transactions, addressing the class imbalance issue in the data presents a significant challenge for developing fraud detection algorithms. It is challenging to identify a positive example (fraudulent case), and this challenge increases as more data is gathered, leading to a lower proportion of positive examples. Because of this, research is very important. Models for making predictions were trained in this study utilizing a variety of sampling strategies, including the ANN, GBM, and the RF. Models used SMOTE, RUS, DBSMOTE, and SMOTE plus ENS were all examples of Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTEENN). This research suggests that SMOTE-based sampling techniques will provide positive results. The highest recall (0.81) was achieved by the SMOTE sampling method when a DRF classifier was used. It was determined that this classifier has an accuracy score of 0.87. The Stacked Ensembling algorithm was accomplished using altogether of collected data, and its average performance was 0.78, making it the clear winner.

The discipline of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has already been implemented, a discipline that involves both the formation of skills to use new technologies and the formation of computational thinking necessary for the efficient and intelligent use of these technologies. In order to teach and learn Physics from a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) educational perspective, we initiated optional school courses of IoT, Robotics and AI (approached through Machine Learning). These courses stimulate, at the level of students, computational thinking, creativity and innovation and lead, from an interdisciplinary perspective, to the development of emerging specializations such as Mathematics-Physics-Automation, Mathematics-Physics-Electronics, Mathematics-Physics-Informatics-Robotics etc. In this paper we presented a method of approaching, in the school educational space, the study of wireless communication technologies between smart devices, through an Educational Robotics project.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Learning representations is critical for machine learning and very computation-intensive process. There are many opportunities to introduce efficiencies through parallel and distributed computing. The success of machine learning algorithms depends on data representation. Different representations can expose or hide different features of the data. As we think about the future of learning representations and its impact on machine learning it is important to consider the state of the art of machine learning today, the challenges and opportunities for addressing the computation issues around representation learning, and how to get to deeper understanding and more capabilities in machine learned models. In this talk I will describe 4 ideas related to computational issues in representation learning: reducing uncertainty, developing compact representations, debasing the training data, and developing privacy-preserving representations.","2379-5352","978-1-6654-3281-8","10.1109/ISPDC52870.2021.9521632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9521632","","Computer science;Distributed computing;Viterbi algorithm;Representation learning;Electrical engineering;Uncertainty;Training data","","","","","IEEE","26 Aug 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The appraisal trajectory is a line chart drawn the viewer's own emotional state from the beginning to the end of the content. We think that the appraisal trajectory enables us to handle the viewer's emotional state with a computer. We think to need accumulate basic findings about subjective trajectories; therefore, we develop a tool to collect subjective trajectories: emonotate. This tool provides some features: input and store the various emotional states of viewers and viewers intuitively agreeable input by visual feedback of arbitrary appraisal trajectories. In order to evaluate the validity, we conduct the experiment of 104 participants drawing subjective trajectories based on protagonist emotional state about 2 animation contents and the subjective quantity is the protagonist emotional state.

"Design an Assessment for an Introductory Computer Science Course: A Systematic Literature Review","Q. Cheng; A. Tao; H. Chen; M. M. Samary","Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA; Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA; Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA; Boston College, Chestnut Hill, MA",2022 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"29 Nov 2022","2022","","","1","8","This Research Full Paper presents a literature review on introductory CS assessments. As Computer Science (CS) becomes increasingly popular in the world of big data, more college students are taking introductory CS courses to follow the trend. However, students have different levels of exposure to CS when they start CS in college, varying from no experience to years of coding experience. This disparity in the amount of exposure can pose many problems. In the same intro-level class, some students may think they do not learn anything new, while others believe the professor goes through concepts so fast that they cannot follow the pace. CS professors may also feel confused about how to control the pace and content of introductory courses. Therefore, CS departments need an assessment to measure students’ CS knowledge and then assign them to the appropriate CS introductory courses. Though a vast number of research papers discuss CS introductory courses, few of them focus on developing and validating assessments that evaluate students’ background knowledge (i.e., concept inventory). This paper aims to conduct a systematic literature review to gain an overview of the most important introductory CS contents that need to be assessed, the methods to evaluate students’ understanding of introductory CS concepts, and some existing assessments/concept inventories. By reviewing relevant papers over the last 15 years, we selected 48 papers that are related to assessments and corresponding introductory courses. We collected assessment information and made tables of contents, question types, programming languages, and origins to analyze data. We found that iterations, conditionals, and variables are the most popular assessment contents. Multiple-Choice and Code Writing questions, which are more popular than Code Explaining questions, are the preferred ways of assessing students’ knowledge. Scratch is commonly used as a CS0 assessment language, while Python, Java, C, and Pseudo-codes are employed in CS1 assessments. FCS1, SCS1, and BDSI are existing assessments/concept inventories for CS1 or CS2, but there is not yet a validated assessment or concept inventory that encompasses introductory concepts of CS0 (computational thinking), CS1 (fundamentals), and CS2 (data structure). Designing a comprehensive CS0/CS1/CS2 assessment by using the information collected from our systematic literature review would help students choose the right course and benefit educators and researchers for general use.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962584","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962584","computer science education;introductory CS courses;assessment;concept inventory;systematic literature review","Computer science;Java;Systematics;Codes;Bibliographies;Buildings;Market research","","2","","68","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traffic congestion problems can cause the economy and the environment both directly and indirectly problems, also part of the problem of air pollution. The traffic light management system in the current situation has used a fixed waiting time, which inability to be flexible according to the traffic at different times such as in rush hour and other. It is not efficient enough to manage traffic with fixed waiting time. The organizers came up with the idea of developing an intelligent traffic light system with flexibility according to the number of cars in real-time by reducing waiting time. The paper was designed and developed by implementing the intelligent traffic light system using image processing technology to process the appropriate waiting time from each image frame. Lazarus and OpenGL were used to program based on Pascal language. The software has been developed for receiving traffic video at the intersection to process car image segmentation of each frame and to calculate the distance of the length of the car in each route in addition. It is also possible to calculate the appropriate time for green-light and red-light duration and corresponding to the length of the waiting vehicles in each route at the intersection. This investigated software can be used to reduce the waiting time at the traffic light intersection by 45.35%. In addition, the intelligent traffic light system is also a social development towards a smart city. The project has created the learning environment and computational thinking for society through the process of STEM Education with using IoT and Artificial Intelligence.","","978-1-6654-1680-1","10.1109/SEA-STEM53614.2021.9668057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9668057","image processing;intelligent traffic light;smart intersection;traffic congestion;real-time traffic simulation","Systematics;Smart cities;Green products;Education;Learning (artificial intelligence);Traffic control;Software","","6","","4","IEEE","10 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Teamwork skills are becoming a more desirable trait in industry today and hence more instructors are using teamwork in their engineering courses. ABET also requires engineering degree programs to have student outcomes that provide them with ""an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives."" This, however, comes with its challenges because the literature suggests that random or student-selected teams tend to lead to dysfunctional behaviors. Instructor-designated academic teams based on skills, learning personalities, and demographics are known to be more effective in promoting learning and positive interactions. Creating optimal homogeneous or heterogeneous teams based on multiple criteria (e.g., prior knowledge, skills, abilities, psychosocial, demographics) can be a complex and time-consuming task when done manually, especially when large numbers of students are involved.This study presents an expansion of previous work that used single-criterion genetic algorithm optimization of teams in a first-year classroom. The research question answered in this study is, how do teams formed using an algorithm that optimizes multiple criteria with genetic algorithms represent heterogeneity when compared to teams formed manually? Using a Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA), optimization of multiple skills is conducted to attain uniform heterogeneity in the classroom. The algorithm uses discrete integer-type representations as a basic unit of team configuration. Self-reported student competency data on three different computational skills were used. Teams were formed for approximately 1300 students enrolled in a first-year engineering design thinking course at a large Midwestern University. Four-member teams were maximized with a minimum number of teams with 3 students in each section. Average skills of the teams are calculated and the standard deviation in class is minimized for each of three skills parallelly. The algorithm also aims to maintain diversity of teams based on gender and ethnicity.Results presented include visualization of team-configurations and comparison with teams formed manually using the same criteria. The aim of the algorithm is to optimize students into teams that have skills and demographics uniformly distributed across the classroom. Future implications of this study include the potential to use flexible algorithm-based team formations that are built with standard genetic operators so that optimization criteria can be modified by the instructor. Such algorithms can reduce the time needed to manually form teams by a considerable amount and optimize the distribution of skills more uniformly. Steps to further this study will involve investigating whether teams formed using these criteria are more effective.","2377-634X","978-1-6654-6244-0","10.1109/FIE56618.2022.9962741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9962741","genetic algorithm;multi-criteria optimization;team formation","Industries;Leadership;Genetics;Question answering (information retrieval);Teamwork;Behavioral sciences;Task analysis","","1","","12","IEEE","29 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We posit that a new and radically more efficient foundation for computing lies at the intersection of superconductor electronics and delay-coded computation. Building on recent work in race logic, we show that superconducting circuits can naturally compute directly over temporal relationships between pulse arrivals; that the computational relationships between those pulse arrivals can be formalized through a functional extension to a temporal predicate logic used in the verification community; and that the resulting architectures can operate asynchronously and describe real and useful computations.

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking `big' by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking `deep' by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that `business travel', which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3074559","ERASMUS + KA2 Projects “Information Technology Governance for Tunisian Universities”(grant numbers:561614-EPP-1-2015-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9409047","Deep people analytics;employee attrition;retention;prediction;interpretation;policies recommendation","Big Data;Organizations;Radio frequency;Predictive models;Support vector machines;Data models;Analytical models","","42","","40","CCBY","20 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"An Attention Approach for Dimensionality Reduction That Can Correct Feature Collection Skewness","Z. Wang; L.

However, in practice, the skewness error during the extraction process affects the feature information owing to the implementation of the global average pooling operation, which eventually lowers the performance of the network design. We think that when the weight is activated, the spatial information is effectively captured while the extraction range of the channel information is narrowed. We also think that because the weight is activated using multiple local extraction substitutions, the influence of skewness error can be effectively reduced. As a result, we suggest dimensionality reduction attention(RA) in this study as a new type of attention mechanism. Dimensionality reduction attention is a method of combining spatial information and channel information into a new feature distribution by aggregating dimensionality reduction of feature information, in contrast to other attentions that act on distinct feature tensors in space and channel. Under the premise of capturing long-distance context information and guaranteeing feature coordinates, it may realize the locality of spatial information through this operation and identify the local information of each channel. To completely display the important feature information, the produced feature maps are then encoded into two complimentary attention maps along the spatial and channel directions, respectively. Our dimension reduction focus is a straightforward and all-encompassing module. We run tests on various datasets using various deep architectures and various class designs.

The students’ difficulties lead to failure, lack of motivation, and abandonment of courses. The problem is more significant in computer courses, where learning programming is essential. Programming is difficult and requires a lot of work from teachers and students. Programming is a process of transforming a mental plan into a computer program. The main goal of teaching programming is for students to develop their skills to create computer programs that solve real problems. There are several factors that can be at the origin of the problem, such as the abstract concepts that programming implies; the skills needed to solve problems; the mental skills needed to decompose problems; many of the students never had the opportunity to practice computational thinking or programming; students must know the syntax, semantics, and structure of a new unnatural language in a short period of time. In this work, we present a set of strategies, included in an application, with the objective of helping teachers and students. Early identification of potential problems and prompt response is critical to preventing student failure and reducing dropout rates. This work also describes a predictive machine learning (neural network) model of student failure based on the student profile, which is built over the course of programming lessons by continuously monitoring and evaluating student activities.","","978-1-6654-4024-0","10.1109/SIIE53363.2021.9583623","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9583623","introductory programming;teaching programming;learning programming;CS1;intelligent tutoring system;neural networks;predict success","Education;Neural networks;Semantics;Machine learning;Tools;Syntactics;Predictive models","","6","","40","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We consider an approximately envy-free fair allocation of demands to limited-capacity vehicles based on agents' accumulated utility over a finite time horizon, representing for example monetary reward or utilization level. We propose a scalable approach based on the construction of assignment graphs that relate agents to routes and demands, and pose the problem as an Integer Linear Program (ILP). Routes for assignments are computed using automata-based methods for each vehicle and demands sets of size at most the capacity of the vehicle while taking into account their pickup wait time and delay tolerances. In addition, we integrate utility-based weights in the assignment graph and ILP to ensure approximative fair allocation. We demonstrate the computational and operational performance of our methods in ride-sharing case studies over a large environment in mid-Manhattan and Linear Temporal Logic demands with stochastic arrival times.

Can we modify the gender appearance of a face image without changing its identity information? Is there any specific feature responsible for the perception of femininity/masculinity in a given face image? Those questions are appealing from both computer vision and visual perception perspectives. To shed light upon them, we propose to develop a GAN based approach toward face gender transfer and study the relevance of learned feature representations to face gender perception. Our key contributions include: 1) an architecture design with specially tailored loss functions in the feature space for face gender transfer; 2) the introduction of a novel probabilistic gender mask to facilitate achieving both the objectives of gender transfer and identity preservation; and 3) identification of sparse features (≈ 20 out of 256) uniquely responsible for face gender perception. Extensive experimental results are reported to demonstrate not only the superiority of the proposed face gender transfer technique (in terms of visual quality of reconstructed images) but also the effectiveness of gender feature representation learning (in terms of the high correlation between the learned sparse features and the perceived gender information). Our findings seem to corroborate a hypothesis about the independence between face recognizability and gender classifiability in the literature of psychology. We expect this work will stimulate more computational studies of different face perception attributes including race, age, attractiveness, and trustworthiness.","2473-9944","978-1-6654-0191-3","10.1109/ICCVW54120.2021.00454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9607409","","Computer vision;Visualization;Face recognition;Ultraviolet sources;Psychology;Computer architecture;Reflection","","2","","57","IEEE","24 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these programs often face challenges in such courses due to their diverse student body, with students often lacking profound digital competencies and technical background. While gender diversity aspects have been broadly studied in the past, other diversity dimensions such as ethnicity, age, or educational background have largely been neglected thus far. In this paper, we report on our experiences in teaching an introductory programming course to first-year Business Informatics bachelor students. After undergoing fundamental changes in our teaching concepts and the provided learning material, we explore what diversity factors play an important role when teaching programming to non-computer science students, and how diversity is perceived by lecturers and tutors.

The curriculum serves middle school students to develop apps for social impact. The partnership focuses on bridging the gap between STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) and community and gender gap within STEM. The project is based on Culturally Responsive Pedagogy (CRP), which includes the importance of recognizing students’ culture in all facets of learning. The project employs a researcher-practitioner partnership (RPP) model, which recognizes that transformational change can occur in educational ecosystems that connect research, policy, practice, and community work.The project curriculum was collaboratively developed by CS researchers, teacher-practitioners, and school administrators. Middle school students develop their own apps that support socially relevant activities in their communities. Using the RPP process, continuous feedback from researchers, teacher-practitioners, and students shaped the curriculum design. Key feedback was collected via one-on-one meetings with the teacher-practitioners, which bridged the visions and knowledge among different groups of the project partners.The curriculum includes the areas of computing and society, digital tools and collaboration, computing systems, and computational thinking. The curriculum helps students develop a critical consciousness of the role they can play in affecting their communities through computing, and empower them to move beyond simply learning to code [1]. The curriculum strives to demonstrate how to integrate computing across middle school subjects in a culturally-responsive way and spread a powerful message of Computer Science for All.

Remanufacturing leads to circularity, while reverse supply chains pose difficulties. Closed loop supply chains are prioritized for reverse supply chain networks. However, alternative supply chains and different market actors make remanufacturing possible through open loops. In this study, a new integrated mathematical approach is proposed to address designing a multi-stage, multi-product and multi-period open loop reverse supply chain network which maximizes the profit and utilizes reverse logistics to benefit the environment in the most efficient way. The proposed approach presents a mixed integer linear programming model (MILP) that uses water treatment facility along with the common components of open loop reverse supply chain (OLSC).

Those problems and the continuous increase in emission limits given by regulators all over the world, are demanding for a change in the current transportation paradigm, leading to a completely electrified solution for both the private and public vehicles. This is particularly true for those cities that relay thoroughly on bus system as main public form of transport. Even though the Colombian capital, Bogota, is a big city with about 10 million people, it does not have a subway or other electric type of massive transport systems, but it has developed a big and articulated bus system.

We set aside, for the moment, thinking about psychology, social science, art and creativity studies and consider what it is that we can do with computers and how this is being used to achieve the goals of computational creativity. The study of algorithms belongs to what Herbert Simon described as The Sciences of the Artificial,<superscript>2</superscript> where we do not study the world as it is, out there, but study our own built environment and the process of building that environment, which we can do in an interactive, probing manner through the production of new designs and inventions. In Simon's words, “engineering, medicine, business, architecture, and painting are concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent—not with how things are but with how they might be—in short, with design.” I begin this chapter by returning to a theme from chapter 1, the essential distinction between processes of generation and evaluation in creativity, which will help frame the relations between algorithms in the construction of artificially creative systems.","","9780262361750","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9394517.pdf&bkn=9394486&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","2 Apr 2021","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"
"Examining the Realities and Nuances of ‘Low-stakes’ Interest-Driven Learning Environments","M.

These opportunities have become increasingly present across contexts and have expanded the possibilities for introducing and sustaining student participation in computing. However, while these experiences tend to be effective ways for engaging new participants and new forms of participation, we must be careful to not overlook how ’high-stakes’ these experiences might be for learners. To explore this tension, this paper describes two case studies of students engaging in coding and computational thinking with Minecraft Education Edition. The first case study involves a 7-year-old Black and Latina girl who experiences significant frustration when her computer program destroys significant portions of her project. The second is from a Latino boy who avoids using the coding capabilities in Minecraft EDU out of fear that the code might not work properly. Building on these case studies, this paper suggests that the field take steps to ensure that the language and actions associated with low-stakes and high-stakes are reflective of learner perceptions, and that we design learning experiences that appropriately reflect this nuance.","","978-1-6654-7114-5","10.1109/RESPECT55273.2022.00016","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10343925","Game-based learning;Informal;Formal;Pedagogy","Computer science;Training;Codes;Buildings;Engineering computing;Encoding","","","","28","IEEE","7 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a result, the problem of picture or text sentiment categorization is of tremendous interest. Document level, phrase level, and aspect level sentiment analysis are the three ways for doing sentiment analysis. There are three major jobs at the aspect level. The most important and first objective is to recognise and extract question parts. The second goal is to identify the extremes of diverse points of view on various characteristics: positive, negative, and neutral. Next task is determined by compiling a list of terms that are similar to features.

To reduce road accidents, the development of information systems to detect driver inattention and distraction is essential. Currently, distraction detection systems for road vehicles are not yet widely available or are limited to specific causes of driver inattention such as driver fatigue. Despite the increasing automation of driving due to the availability of increasingly sophisticated assistance systems, the human driver will continue to play a longer role as supervisor of vehicle automation. With this in mind, we review the published scientific literature on driver distraction detection methods and integrate the identified approaches into a holistic framework that is the main contribution of the paper. Based on published scientific work, our driver distraction detection framework contains a structured summary of reviewed approaches for detecting the three main distraction detection approaches: manual distraction, visual distraction, and cognitive distraction. Our framework visualizes the whole detection information chain from used sensors, measured data, computed data, computed events, inferred behavior, and inferred distraction type. Besides providing a sound summary for researchers interested in distracted driving, we discuss several practical implications for the development of driver distraction detection systems that can also combine different approaches for higher detection quality.

With the continuous development of artificial intelligence, image-aided diagnosis of brain diseases has been widely studied and concerned. However, many doctors and researchers still doubt the diagnosis basis of the neural network and think that the neural network belongs to a limited interpretable black-box function approximator. They are not sure whether the neural network has learned some interpretive image features like humans. In order to solve this problem, three new models (2D CAM, 3D CAM and 3D Grad-CAM) are proposed for structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) data. The Regions Of Interest (ROI) of subcortical tissues among models and between groups are analyzed based on the heat maps of the three models. The experimental results show that these models mainly distinguish the autism group and the control group according to the voxel value of these ROIs. There are significant differences in mean voxel value and standard deviation of voxel value between the autism group and the control group, such as in the left amygdala, optic chiasm and right hippocampus. According to medical references, these ROIs are closely related to people's speech, cognition and behavior. This can partly explain why autistic patients have unusual symptoms such as speech communication disorder, stereotyped repetitive behavior and so on. The proposed visualization models can provide a good bridge for doctors to understand the brain features learned by the neural network. The research method of this paper may provide a new way for doctors and researchers to find the diagnostic biomarkers of autism, which can greatly speed up the process of modern medical diagnosis and treatment strategies, and liberate doctors from the traditional trial and error.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069211","State Key Laboratory of Magnetic Resonance and Atomic and Molecular Physics(grant numbers:T152102); Scientific and Technological Research of Education Department of Hubei Province(grant numbers:Q20181408); Scientific Research Foundation of Science and Technology Department of Hubei Province(grant numbers:2018CFB190); Doctor Launching Fund of Hubei University of Technology(grant numbers:BSQD20160004); Hubei Chenguang Talented Youth Development Foundation (HBCG)(grant numbers:2017109); Hubei Key Laboratory of Medical Information Analysis and Tumor Diagnosis and Treatment(grant numbers:PJS140012003); Hubei Key Laboratory of Modern Manufacturing Quality Engineering(grant numbers:KFJJ-2020008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9388662","Autism spectrum disorders;class activation mapping;sMRI;biomarker","Brain modeling;Autism;Convolution;Biological neural networks;Biomedical imaging;Medical services;Feature extraction","","9","","44","CCBYNCND","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To improve the efficiency of FPGAs for these new datacenter use cases and data-intensive applications, a new class of reconfigurable acceleration devices (RADs) is emerging. In these devices, the FPGA fine-grained reconfigurable fabric is a component of a bigger monolithic or multi-die system-in-package that can incorporate general-purpose software-programmable cores, domain-specialized accelerator blocks, and high-performance networks-on-chip (NoCs) for efficient communication between these system components. The integration of all these components in a RAD results in a huge design space and requires re-thinking the implementation of applications that need to be migrated from conventional FPGAs to these novel devices. In this work, we introduce RAD-Sim, an architecture simulator that allows rapid design space exploration for RADs and facilitates the study of complex interactions between their various components. We also present a case study that highlights the utility of RAD-Sim in re-designing applications for these novel RADs by mapping a state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) inference FPGA overlay to different RAD instances. Our case study illustrates how RAD-Sim can capture a wide variety of reconfigurable architectures, from conventional FPGAs to devices augmented with hard NoCs, specialized matrix-vector blocks, and 3D-stacked multi-die devices. In addition, we show that our tool can help architects evaluate the effect of specific RAD architecture parameters on end-to-end workload performance. Through RAD-Sim, we also show that novel RADs can potentially achieve  $2.6\times $  better performance on average compared to conventional FPGAs in the key DL application domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204664","Intel/VMware Crossroads 3D-FPGA Academic Research Center; NSERC/Intel Industrial Research Chair in Programmable Silicon; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878097","Deep learning;field-programmable gate arrays;hardware acceleration;network-on-chip;reconfigurable computing","Field programmable gate arrays;Computer architecture;Fabrics;Hardware acceleration;Performance evaluation;Benchmark testing;Memory management;Deep learning;Reconfigurable logic","","6","","53","CCBY","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Generally, the concept of granularity is used for characterizing such an ability, which has been widely explored in literatures. To calculate the parameterized granularity, a naive approach is to find the granularity in terms of the parameter one by one. Nevertheless, such approach can only generate the single parameter based knowledge granularity, and the difference of knowledge granularities among different parameters may be slight. It follows that the knowledge granularity derived from single parameter may be lack of representativeness. In this paper, the continuous parameters based knowledge granularity is proposed, and the corresponding calculation approach is presented. Inspired by the thinking of definite integral in mathematical problems, the calculation approach is mainly implemented by following steps: firstly, the graph formed by granularity and parameter interval is divided into several small rectangles whose length of interval tends to be 0; secondly, the sum of area values of all the small rectangles is calculated; finally, the obtained area value divided by the whole length of parameter interval can be considered as the continuous parameters based knowledge granularity.

We think that representation decomposed into content and style can be effectively exploited for cross modal facial image synthesis. However, we have observed that unidirectional application of decomposed representation based style transfer in case of large modality gap does not work well for this purpose. Unlike existing image synthesis methods that typically formulate image synthesis as an unidirectional feed forward mapping, our network utilizes mutual interaction between two opposite mappings in a collaborative way to address complex image synthesis problem with large modality gap. The proposed bidirectional network aligns shape content from two modalities and exchanges their appearance styles using feature maps of the layers in the encoder space. This allows us to effectively retain the shape content and transfer style details for synthesizing each modality. Focusing on facial images, we consider facial photo, sketch, and color-coded semantic segmentation as different modalities. The bidirectional synthesis results for the pairs of these modalities show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

"An Expressway Driving Stress Prediction Model Based on Vehicle, Road and Environment Features","S. Zhong; X. Fu; W. Lu; F. Tang; Y.

Traditional stress prediction relies extensively on psychological data and is limited by the unpopularity of psychological data collection technology, which cannot be applied in daily life on a large scale. In recent years, advances in high-precision visual analysis technology represented by deep learning have laid the foundation for automated and large-scale visual environment analysis. This study proposes a framework for the quantitative analysis of highway driving stress based on multiple vehicle, road, and environmental factors. A dilated residual network model and other methods were used to extract visual environmental indexes. Combined with multisource data such as traffic volume and road design parameters, the LightGBM method was used to construct an expressway driving stress prediction model with high accuracy. The MAE, RMSE and  $R^{2}$  values of the proposed model are 0.042, 0.004 and 0.881, respectively, demonstrating the usefulness for scaled and efficient assessment of expressway stress loads. The SHAP method was used to explore the relationship between different influencing factors and driving stress to quantify the mechanism of vehicle, road and environment influences on stress load, and to propose recommendations for highway design and planning from the perspective of reducing stress load. This study provides a new way of thinking to quantitatively investigate the link between multiple road traffic factors and driving stress, providing efficient and large-scale assessment of expressway driving stress, as well as proposing some suggestions for highway design and planning to enhance stress reduction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3165570","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:51978283,51778242); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9751071","Expressway;prediction model;driving stress;LightGBM method;SHAP method","Stress;Vehicles;Psychology;Roads;Task analysis;Predictive models;Load modeling","","2","","34","CCBY","7 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The present study formulated the selection of an IPL squad as a multi-objective optimization problem with the objectives of maximizing the batting and bowling performance of the squad, in which a player’s performance is estimated using an efficient Batting Performance Factor and Combined Bowling Rate. Also, the proposed model tries to formulate a balanced squad by constraining the number of pure batters, pure bowlers, and all-rounders. Bounds are also considered on star players to enhance the performance of the squad and also from the income prospects of IPL. The problem in itself is treated as a 0/1 knapsack problem for which two combinatorial optimization algorithms, namely, BNSGA-II and INSGA-II, are developed. These algorithms were compared with existing modified NSGA-II for IPL team selection and three other popular multi-objective optimization algorithms, NSGA-II, NSDE, and MOPSO-CD, on the basis of standard performance metrics: hypervolume, inverted generational distance, and number of Pareto optimal solutions. Both algorithms performed well, with BNSGA-II performing better than all the other algorithms considered in this study. The IPL 2020 players’ data validated the applicability of the proposed model and algorithms. The trade-off squads contained players of each expertise in appropriate proportions. Further analysis of the trade-off squads demonstrated that many theoretically selected players performed well in IPL 2020 matches.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204649","Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), Ministry of Science and Technology, Government of India(grant numbers:09/143(0966)/2019-EMR-I); Metaheuristics Framework for Combinatorial Optimization Problems (META-MO-COPS)(grant numbers:DST/INT/Czech/P-12/2019); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9878123","Cricket;twenty20;knapsack problem;combinatorial;Indian premier league;multi-objective;optimization;squad selection","Optimization;Sorting;Franchising;Optimization methods;Genetic algorithms;Costs;Data models;Sports","","1","","23","CCBY","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It needs to identify important objects in images, extract attributes, tell relationships, and help the machine generate human-like descriptions. Recent works in deep neural networks have greatly improved the performance of image caption models. However, machines are still unable to imitate the way humans think, talk and communicate, so image captioning remains an ongoing task. It is thus very important to keep up with the latest research and results in the field of image captioning whereas publications on this topic are numerous. Our work aims to help researchers to have a macro-level understanding of image captioning from four aspects: spatial-temporal distribution characteristics, collaborative networks, trends in subject research, and historical evolutionary path. We employ scientometric visualization methods to achieve this goal. The results show that China has published the largest amount of publications in image captioning, but the United States has the greatest impact on research in this area. Besides, thirteen academic groups are identified in the field of image description, with institutions such as Microsoft, Google, Australian National University, and Georgia Institute of Technology being the most prominent research institutions. Meanwhile, we find that evaluation methods, datasets, novel image captioning models based on generative adversarial networks, reinforcement learning, and Transformer, as well as remote sensing image captioning, are the new research trends. Lastly, we conclude that image captioning research has gone through three major development stages from 2010 to 2020, and on this basis, we propose a more comprehensive taxonomy of image captioning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129782","National Natural Science Foundation of China Program(grant numbers:41930107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623457","Image captioning;image description generation;scientometric analysis;visualization","Bibliometrics;Visualization;Indexes;Conferences;Remote sensing;Market research;Image recognition","","1","","114","CCBY","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There still remains a challenge of how to improve the performance of community detection in real-world scenario. Some researchers think that the content in networks is helpful to identify communities, and also focus on combining network topology with node contents, alongside the eradication of inauspicious performance. Furthermore, network topology is often sparse, which is reflected in the lack of capability to represent communities. To address the above problems, this study identifies a novel non-negative matrix factorization method which both employs network embedding to enhance the representation power of network topology for communities and also integrates network topology and node contents for further raising the quality of community detection. Furthermore, we then obtain the parameters of the model for finding communities which is based on model inference. Alongside both synthetic and real-world networks with ground-truths, we compare the new method with the state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results show that the new method obtains significant improvement for community detection both by incorporating node contents and by enhancing network topology.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3198979","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61876128,61976120); Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:BK20191445); Natural Science Foundation of the Higher Education Institutions of Jiangsu Province(grant numbers:21KJB520018); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9857902","Community detection;network embedding;node contents;non-negative matrix factorization","Network topology;Stochastic processes;Probabilistic logic;Complex networks;Topology;Social networking (online);Behavioral sciences","","","","40","CCBY","16 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Nevertheless, the speed at which all of this knowledge is being generated has highlighted the shortcomings of the research community in creating well-organized, standardized, and structured databases. Despite the efforts of the community to develop advanced integrative platforms such as CovidGraph, we have identified some limitations when using these solutions that we think are derived from the lack of a sound ontological schema to guide the collection, standardization, and integration of data. This work explores the advantages and disadvantages for the final user of building advanced information systems using a Model Driven Development approach to integrate heterogeneous and complex data using an ontological background as a basis. As a proof of concept, we built a database (CovProt) to integrate data about different aspects of SARS-CoV-2 using this approach, we analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of using this approach compared to CovidGraph by performing a set of queries in CovProt and CovidGraph, and finally, we compared the structure and redundancy of the retrieved data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3169268","Spanish State Research Agency and the Generalitat Valenciana(grant numbers:PROMETEO/2018/176,INNEST/2021/57); Spanish Ministry of Universities and the Universitat Politècnica de València under the Margarita Salas Next Generation EU Grant; European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the European Union NextGenerationEU/Plan de Recuperación, Transformación y Resiliencia (PRTR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761240","Conceptual model;graph data model;MDD;COVID-19;design methods","Databases;COVID-19;Data models;Proteins;Coronaviruses;Unified modeling language;Soft sensors","","","","17","CCBYNCND","21 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There are limited resources, insufficient knowledge in the field, feasibility, and many other technical problems on the way to creating AI. Artificial Intelligence currently remains a scientific field related to computer modeling of human intellectual functions. Artificial intelligence systems are generally used to refer to a computer system's ability to perform tasks that are intrinsic to human intelligence, such as logical inference and learning tasks. Any task whose solution algorithm is not known in advance or whose data are incomplete can be classified as an AI task. Systems, programs performing actions to solve a task can be classified as AI if their activity is similar to the result of a human in solving the same task. Therefore, a number of software means can be referred to as AI: text recognition systems, automated design, self-training programs, etc. But not only for this reason, but also because they operate on similar principles to humans. There are two main promising directions in AI research. The first is to bring AI systems closer to the principles of human thinking. The second is to create AI representing the integration of already developed AI systems into a single system capable of solving human problems.","2246-0853","","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10254729","","Text recognition;Human intelligence;Computational modeling;Standardization;Learning (artificial intelligence);Software;Inference algorithms","","","","0","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

The author, a professor at Iowa State University, has been working on electricity market design and agent-based computational economics for many years. Her extensive academic, research, and industry experiences, as well as her training in both economics and mathematics, make her highly qualified to provide fresh thinking in this important area. The book proposes the adoption of swing contracts between the system operator and relevant resources to provide flexibility. This flexibility is represented in the form of future availability of dispatchable power paths (“reserve”) with prespecified physical attributes and economic attributes (for pricing purposes). The book contains rigorous mathematical descriptions of the proposed mechanism and implementations.","1558-4216","","10.1109/MPE.2022.3150811","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9761178","","Book reviews;Power markets;Electricity supply industry;Costs;Investment;Power system;Contracts;Pricing","","","","0","IEEE","21 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
