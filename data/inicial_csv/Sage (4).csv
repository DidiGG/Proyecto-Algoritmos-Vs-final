Gülgün Afacan Adanır and Gulshat Muhametjanova,"Why Do Young Kyrgyz Individuals Use Instagram? An Investigation of the Impacts of Surveillance/Knowledge About Others, Documentation and Self-expression Factors",Media Watch,15,3,297–312,2024a,10.1177/09760911241257817,,"This study investigated the motivational factors that impact Instagram use among young Kyrgyz individuals. The theoretical framework was based on the uses and gratifications theory (UGT). In this respect, the study considered a target group actively using the Internet and social media applications. The study sample covers 515 Kyrgyz individuals between 14 and 23. Data from the sample were collected through a questionnaire based on the UGT. The study adopted a quantitative approach; hence, statistical approaches such as factor analysis, multivariate analysis of variance and correlation analysis were employed for the data analysis. According to the study results, three factors are related to Instagram use among young Kyrgyz individuals. These three factors were surveillance/knowledge about others, documentation and self-expression. The study’s results additionally demonstrated that demographic characteristics (age, gender, status of individuals, time spent on Instagram) have a different impact on individuals’ Instagram use. While gender affected only the documentation factor, time spent on Instagram was significant in all three factors: surveillance/knowledge about others, documentation and self-expression."

By building models, performing investigations, examining and explaining experimental results, using theoretical and computational thinking, constructing representations, undergraduates can acquire a deeper understanding of fundamental disciplinary concepts while reinforcing transversal abilities. In this framework, Engineering courses should be designed with the final objective to develop practical skills, focusing on hands-on activities. This contribution presents two different inquiry-based learning environments recently experienced at the University of Palermo in the context of bioelectronic and biomedical Engineering. The first study describes a laboratory activity about digital ophthalmologic signal classification; the second laboratory focuses on the analysis of the prefrontal cortex activation during a memory task using functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We introduce and discuss the learning workshops, with the research objective of improving current instruction and training in Engineering courses. Indeed, this contribution aims to suggest a conceptual framework in the form of a structured elective suite of modules tailored to meet the needs of Engineering graduates. The outcomes of both studies seem to highlight that self-directed learning activities could enhance students’ enthusiasm to learn and engagement in engineering investigations, contributing to improve the achievements of students and acquire a more effective learning approach."

The aim of this study is to determine the most effective set of information technologies, which can help media specialists develop competencies and thus stay competitive in the labor market. The research methodology is based on the overview of case studies concerning issues such as technology trends, human capital, and talent competitiveness. The qualitative analysis was performed in three phases – overviewing case studies, distinguishing trends and problem-solving. Analyzing data on skill supply and demand, the key skills needed to succeed in the workplace were identified. The results of the three-phase research revealed that the most important competencies needed to be in demand today are technology literacy, stress tolerance, and big data skills. The major finding of this study is that a media specialist needs to focus on learning throughout his life and gain hard and soft skills in the process."

The study rational is based on evidence for paired associated learning of visual-verbal stimuli, integrated with the use of a tangible technological device (educational floor robot) as means for promoting letter knowledge. Two intervention groups (N = 60) participated. The intervention lasted for eight sessions of phonological training; each dedicated to one target letter. Participants were asked to navigate the robot’s path from a current stopping point to the next according to phonological information processing. Both groups went through the same procedure, but using a different type of mat (one with and one without a visual form of the letter). A control group (N = 30) of at-risk preschoolers received no intervention except for their preschool educational routine. We found that children who participated in phonological training with linkage to the visual form of the letter scored higher in post-intervention tests. Among other proposed explanations, we mention the advantages of using a tangible robot and seemingly three-dimensional letters, along with the tendency to consider visual features while processing language stimulus among children with dyslexia."
Youngkyun Baek and Achraf Touati,Comparing Collaborative and Cooperative Gameplay for Academic and Gaming Achievements,Journal of Educational Computing Research,57,8,2110–2140,2020e,10.1177/0735633118825385,,"This article reports an empirical study that explores gender differences in both cooperative and collaborative social gaming in relation to achievements and attitudes. Another aim was to compare students’ game attitudes, feelings toward group work, and achievements in cooperative versus collaborative digital game-based learning environments. One hundred sixty-four, sixth-grade students from five different classrooms at an elementary school in South Korea participated voluntarily in this study. A total of 2 boys and 2 girls were randomly assigned to each group, resulting in 20 groups for each of the grouping conditions. Based on interaction effects, results suggest that male students show more positive game attitudes in collaborative conditions, whereas female students show more positive game attitudes in cooperative conditions. Data also suggest that males show more positive feelings toward group work than females, irrespective of grouping conditions. Regarding academic and gaming achievements, female students showed higher academic achievement in collaborative conditions, while male students scored higher on academic achievement under cooperative conditions. Findings from this study indicate that gender-balanced groups show significantly higher gaming achievement in collaboration compared with cooperation. Results are interpreted with reference to future research and classroom practices."

We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews with purposively selected medical and health professionals (N = 15) regarding their perspectives and experiences with VAPN policy and its implementation. Data were analysed following a Reflexive Thematic Analysis approach. Respondents highlighted the flexibility in VAPN policy implementation and described adjustments made by health workers. Women were seen as vulnerable and lacked access to support against gender-based violence. Men who have sex with men could face exclusion from important social networks. Age-appropriate VAPN assistance was also considered unavailable for sexually active children. Embedding understandings of identity, belonging, and safety into VAPN could address individual priorities and needs. Community support networks, tailored care for children, and family-orientated approaches to HIV notification may overcome issues relating to vulnerability and marginalisation."

The current study conducted a systematic literature review to analyze research studies that conducted investigations related to implementations of CS unplugged activities. A systematic review procedure was developed and applied to detect and subsequently review relevant research studies published from 2010 to 2019. It was found that 55 research studies (17 articles + 38 conference proceedings) satisfied the inclusion criteria for the analysis. These research studies were then examined with regard to their demographic characteristics, research methodologies, research results, and main findings. It was found that the unplugged approach was realized and utilized differently among researchers. The majority of the studies used the CS unplugged term when referring to “paper–pencil activities,” “problem solving,” “storytelling,” “games,” “tangible programming,” and even “robotics.”"
Rebecca Yvonne Bayeck,Examining Board Gameplay and Learning: A Multidisciplinary Review of Recent Research,Simulation & Gaming,51,4,411–431,2020h,10.1177/1046878119901286,,"Background Recent years have seen the resurgence of board games designed for entertainment, and to teach or explicate real life problems. The revival of board gameplay has been discussed in mainstream media, and has drawn the attention of researchers. Yet, in the field of games studies, the conception of games as learning spaces is mostly emphasized through digital/video games. Aim This literature review reveals the current knowledge regarding the learning potential of board games in various settings, subjects, and diverse learners. Results Board games are spaces for mathematical learning and learning spaces that can enable the learning of various contents. Board games allow for various interactions that result in players engaging in computational thinking, teamwork, and creativity. Conclusion The relationship between board gameplay and learning is evidenced across disciplines and countries. Board games simplify complex issues and systems, which make them appropriate to further explore learning and concepts such as motivation and computational thinking in formal and informal settings. Furthermore, there is need to expand research on learning in commercial board games."

An effective way of initiating young students in this world consists in proposing them stimulating challenges. This work presents a robotic platform that has been successfully used to develop a competition (called Drone Challenge) in which students had to program the navigation system for a simulated unmanned aerial vehicle (or drone). Both the competition and the supporting platform are described in detail. In particular, the article provides a deep technical description of the main components of the platform, namely the drone simulator and the navigation development framework. The results of the survey conducted after the challenge point to the suitability of the working platform deployed."
Taina Bucher,‘Machines don’t have instincts’: Articulating the computational in journalism,New Media & Society,19,6,918–933,2017j,10.1177/1461444815624182,,"This article examines the articulation of computational journalism, focusing on how the meaning of the computational is discursively constructed and mobilized as a specific constellation of intelligibility within news organizations. Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age."

R is an open-source software in constant development that has gained a lot of popularity within statistical communities and sports analytics. This work presents a systematic review of the available R CRAN sport packages following PRISMA guidelines. We consider all packages active as of 18 February 2021. A total of 81 sport R packages created since 2006 were detected. Of these, 35.9% were authored by an American national, 69.1% include a dataset, 43.2% provide vignettes, and 65.4% have been updated at least once. The sport with the highest representation is basketball (n = 14, 17.3%), followed by soccer (n = 12, 14.8%) and packages related to physical activity (n = 11, 13.6%). There are no sports packages directed solely for the female gender, while 59.3% of packages are focused on professional athletes. Fifty packages (61.7%) are related to the sports performance analysis category, and web scraping (n = 43, 53.1%) was the main functionality in the collected packages. The creation of new R packages in the area of sports could help solve questions and tasks that still remain a challenge in this field, while continuing to help to improve the level of statistical education and computational thinking skills."

Methods: A total of 1,159 students were recruited. Structural equation analysis was performed using IBM Amos Graphics®. Results: Excellent fit indices were obtained, forming a final scale composed of nine indicators and two factors. The first dimension was associated with cognitive skills and adaptability, grouping together the skills of finding meaning, adaptable thinking, and understanding management. The second dimension comprises collaborative skills, as social intelligence and virtual collaboration. Discussion: Collaboration skills were more developed within those undertaking PT, while baccalaureate students had more strongly developed mastery over new media. This scale allows to know effectively the development of the work skills set by the European Union in the 2030 horizon. These findings contribute interesting data regarding the development of training strategies to support insertion into the job market."
Chih-Kai Chang,Effects of Using Alice and Scratch in an Introductory Programming Course for Corrective Instruction,Journal of Educational Computing Research,51,2,185–204,2014n,10.2190/EC.51.2.c,,"Scratch, a visual programming language, was used in many studies in computer science education. Most of them reported positive results by integrating Scratch into K-12 computer courses. However, the object-oriented concept, one of the important computational thinking skills, is not represented well in Scratch. Alice, another visual programming language, seems to have better illustration of the object-oriented concept for programming novices. To demonstrate effects of Alice and Scratch, we compared students’ responses to both visual programming languages, especially for students with low performances, in an introductory programming course. The relationships among learning engagement, learning anxiety, and learning playfulness were explored. The results could be referred to by computer science instructors to select proper visual programming language for corrective instruction."

In this study, an equation puzzle game was developed by combining pattern recognition with algebraic reasoning, and scaffolding was designed to support learners’ learning. Sixty participants were enrolled in this study, divided into a control group and an experimental group to compare the results and differences in game achievement, flow, anxiety, and motivation of participants with and without algebraic reasoning scaffolding. The results of the study showed that the participants in both groups had positive flow and motivation during the game, did not feel over-anxious, and there was no significant difference in the game achievement of the two groups. In addition, the game with the scaffolding may have the potential to make a positive correlation between game achievement and psychological status. The results of this study indicated that the game did not cause too much anxiety to the participants. The scaffolding-based design achieves the intended effect on the participants’ assistance and facilitates the participants’ engagement in pattern recognition problem solving. And as learners became more focused and engaged, they could also perform better in the game. This game mechanism can be used as a reference for designing pattern recognition games."

Researchers have addressed that students’ conceptions of learning influence their approaches to learning, and thus impact their learning outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to uncover students’ conceptions of programming learning (CoPL) and approaches to programming learning (APL), and analyzed the differences between CS and non-CS students. Phenomenographic analysis was adopted to analyze 31 college students (20 CS-related, and 11 not) from northern Taiwan. Results revealed six categories of CoPL hierarchically: 1. memorizing concepts, logic, and syntax, 2. computing and practicing programming writing, 3. expressing programmers’ ideas and relieving pressure, 4. applying and understanding, 5. increasing one’s knowledge and improving one’s competence, and 6. seeing in a new way. Four categories of APL were also found, namely: 1. copying from the textbook, teachers, or others, 2. rote memory, 3. multiple exploration attempts, and 4. online or offline community interactions. Furthermore, we found that most CS students held higher level CoPL (e.g., seeing in a new way) than non-CS students. However, compared with non-CS students, CS students adopted more surface approaches to learning programming, such as copying and rote memory. Implications are discussed."

Cybersecurity is of increasing importance in our interconnected world, yet the field has a growing workforce deficit and an underrepresentation of women and people of color. In an effort to address these issues, many digital games have been created to teach individuals about cybersecurity and keeping themselves, their data, and their networks safe. Intervention. We present the results of a systematic review of digital games related to cybersecurity as a means to understand how players are being introduced to cybersecurity in game-based contexts. Methods. Using a systematic search, we identified 181 games related to cybersecurity (either through content or aesthetics) by searching the Apple App Store, the Google Play Store, Steam, and the web broadly. Each game was played for up to an hour and characteristics such as the game story, game elements, and presentation of cybersecurity were gathered. Results. We found diverse conceptualizations of cybersecurity and of cybersecurity professionals. Further, the nature of games and the framing of cybersecurity varied by the platform and device on which the game was available (computer, mobile, or web). Web games were most likely to present cybersecurity as cyber safety and were more likely to be a gamified quiz or worksheet. Computer and mobile games tended to present cybersecurity through game aesthetics or deep content engagement. The games mirrored the underrepresentation of women and minoritized individuals in the field. Discussion. With the variety of digital cybersecurity games and the differences in games based on the platform on which the game is available, it is important game developers move beyond presenting cybersecurity through gamification and focusing on cyber safety. The current scope of cybersecurity games leaves room for the development of games focused on deeper content engagement with cybersecurity topics in an environment conducive to the broadening participation goals of the cybersecurity field."

South Africa (SA) is a country with one of the largest HIV epidemics worldwide and a growing burden of NCDs where the collision of these epidemics poses a major public health challenge. Methods Using data from a large nationally representative survey, the South Africa Demographic and Health Survey (SADHS 2016), we conducted a geospatial analysis of several diseases including HIV, tuberculosis (TB), cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases to identify areas with a high burden of co-morbidity within the country. We explored the spatial structure of each disease and associations between diseases using different spatial and visual data methodologies. We also assessed the individual level co-occurrence of HIV and the other diseases included in the analysis. Results The spatial distribution for HIV prevalence showed that this epidemic is most intense in the eastern region of the country, mostly within the Gauteng, Mpumalanga, and Kwazulu-Natal provinces. In contrast, chronic diseases had their highest prevalence rates the southern region of the country, particularly in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces. Individual-level analyses were consistent with the spatial correlations and found no statistically significant associations between HIV infection and the presence of any NCDs. Conclusions We found no evidence of geospatial overlap between the HIV epidemic and NCDs in SA. These results evidence the complex epidemiological landscape of the country, characterized by geographically distinct areas exhibiting different health burdens. The detailed description of the heterogenous prevalence of HIV and NCDs in SA reported in this study could be a useful tool to inform and direct policies to enhance targeted health service delivery according to the local health needs of each community."

There is a limited number of studies experimentally demonstrating that pair programming is effective in the educational context. Therefore, in this study, solo and pair programming were compared in terms of flow experience, coding quality, and coding achievement. The method used in this study is a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design. The study group consists of 42 volunteer senior university students (28 males, 14 females). While solo programming was performed in the control group, pair programming was performed in the experimental group. It was concluded that the flow experience of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group in four weeks of the six-week implementation, whereas the coding quality of the experimental group was higher in three weeks. No difference was found in the other weeks in terms of both flow experience and coding quality. Although the coding achievement of both the control and experimental groups increased in the study, the experimental group did not exhibit better performance in terms of coding achievement. In conclusion, since it was revealed in this study that pair programming is effective, it is recommended to use pair programming more frequently in educational settings."

In line with this goal, five individual difference variables of gender, learning style, friendship, the conscientiousness component of personality traits, and prior knowledge of coding were determined in order to use them in the determination of pairs in pair programming. In the quantitative section of this mixed study, a non-equivalent control group posttest only experimental design was utilized. Sixty-four volunteer university students were included in the study. As a result of the study, it was determined that the homogeneous group experienced a higher level of flow in the case of learning style. On the other hand, in the case of friendship, the homogeneous group experienced a higher level of flow, while the heterogeneous group demonstrated a higher level of coding performance. Concerning the conscientiousness component of personality traits, the heterogeneous group showed a higher level of coding performance. In line with these findings, suggestions for both researchers and practitioners of coding education were made in the full text."

This was a 3-year qualitative study of 36 master’s students in their final capstone course in an online graduate adult education program. The primary research question was Can developing ePortfolios foster reflective and deeper learning in an online graduate adult education program? Researchers analyzed student responses to three guideline questions for the development of their ePortfolios: (a) What story did your ePortfolio tell?, (b) What surprised you?, and (c) What did you learn about yourself? These questions were designed to stimulate students’ thinking about their learning from the ePortfolio process, artifacts, and experience in the degree program. Through thematic analysis of student responses to these questions, three predominant themes emerged that provided evidence for reflective and deeper learning. The three themes were as follows: (a) Students became more reflective learners who frequently experienced deeper transformative learning, (b) Students were surprised by greater self-discovery and significant personal growth exceeding their expectations, and (c) Students found new personal strengths. Specific recommendations were provided about how to use ePortfolios in graduate adult education programs to foster reflective and deeper learning."

Although deep learning models have shown promising results in many domains, the event log dataset in many online courses may not be large enough for deep learning models to approximate the probability distribution of students’ learning sequence due to a lack of participants. This study proposes a deep learning framework to help uncover the learning progression of learners. It aims to produce a graphical representation of the overall educational process from event logs. Our framework adopts the Smith–Waterman algorithm from the bioinformatics field to evaluate general learning sequences generated from deep learning models. Using our framework, we compare the performance of a deep learning model with the modified cross-attention layer and a model without modification and find that the modified model outperforms the other. The contribution of this framework is that it enables the use of neural architecture search techniques to uncover students’ general learning sequence irrespective of the dataset’s size. The framework also helps educators identify education materials that present as learning bottlenecks, enabling them to improve the materials and their respective layout order, thus facilitating student learning."

However, increasing integration of programming in K–12 shows that the block-based and text-based dichotomy of programming environments does not reflect the spectrum of their affordance. Hence, educators are confronted with a fundamental hurdle of matching programming environments with learners’ cognitive abilities and learning objectives. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing 111 articles evaluating the affordances of programming environments to identify both structural and theoretical models to support educators’ choice of programming environments. The following dimensions of programming environments were identified: connectivity mode, interface natural language, language inheritance, age appropriateness, cost of environment, output interface, input interface, and project types. For each of these dimensions, the synthesis of the literature ranged from examining its nature and effect on learning programming to the implications of choosing an environment and the critical gaps that future studies should address. The findings offer instructors useful parameters to compare and assess programming environments’ suitability and alignment with learning objectives."

Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students’ debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students’ investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning."

Theoretically, the community of inquiry model was taken as a reference and the effectiveness of the instruction process was evaluated accordingly. Students were preservice teachers studying Computer Education and Information Technology in the third grade in the Van region in Turkey. There were a total of 19 students, of which 12 are male and seven are female. FC process was carried out in the spring semester of 2018–2019 and lasted 11 weeks in total. A mixed-method design was used to gathering the data. Therefore, the research design was an explanatory design from mixed-methods designs. The quantitative data collection tool was the Turkish version of the Community of Inquiry Survey. The quantitative data were analyzed by dividing the students into very low, low, high, and very high levels. The qualitative data collection tool was the interview form created concerning the community of inquiry model. The qualitative data were analyzed by the use of the community of inquiry coding template’s themes. At the end of the instruction process, students had a very high level of cognitive, social, and teaching presence perception. This situation was detailed and supported with the qualitative data obtained. Concerning the cognitive presence, the students firstly talked about that they started the learning process with videos. Regarding the social presence, they mentioned the motivating effect of the questions. About the teaching presence, participants firstly mentioned the direct instruction role of the videos."

The umbrella term computational exploration in journalism (CEJ), embraces the multifaceted development of algorithms, data, and social science methods in reporting and storytelling. CEJ typically involves the journalistic co-creation of quantitative news projects that transcend geographical, disciplinary, and linguistic boundaries. Drawing on extensive empirical data, this article provides a conceptual overview of the field by identifying three main pathways of computational exploration in journalism: the newsroom approach, the academic approach, and the entrepreneurial approach. Implications for changing journalistic practice are discussed, and the theorizing is summed up in a triplex proposition about changing mindset processes coming out of CEJ. The study indicates that the computational exploration not only leads to innovative uses of the technology, but also to innovative ways for journalists to think and behave; journalism innovation leads to innovation journalism."

Findings from a descriptive case study focused on early adolescents as they engaged in digital media composition within an online programming community called Scratch are examined. Specifically, I discuss the contrast in the digital composition experiences of two participants as they leveraged participatory culture in the creation of digital media. This research highlights assumptions made regarding participatory cultures and the need to consider how to foster productive and sustainable digital literacy practices for youth in participatory cultures."

Processes that have always been important for gifted students to learn as they develop potential are embedded in learning code, which engages the beginning programmer in rich and complex authentic projects (Housand et al., 2017). As stakeholders present opportunities for open-ended, creative processes and products, the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA; 2017) and International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE; 2016) Standards can form guidelines for gifted students to self-direct their education through technology. Learning to code results in both cognitive and psychosocial skill development, including creative and critical thinking, logical and systematic reasoning, positive risk-taking and processing of feedback, perseverance through challenges, social skills, and collaboration."

These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets."

It is not about the technology, but bettering peoples’ lives, insist smart city advocates. In this paper, I question the progressive potential of the smart city drawing on the case of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart home and ‘learning to code’ movement, I highlight the limits of such ‘smart’ interventions as they are stunted by the neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating authoritarian consolidation in Singapore. As such, this paper distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy. For smart urbanism to better peoples’ everyday lives, technological ‘solutionism’ needs to be replaced with more human-centric framings and understandings of urban challenges."

In this study, the interaction sequences during the paired programming of preservice teachers was investigated. Lag sequential analysis were used to explore students’ behavioral patterns in pair programming. The participants of the study consist of 14 students, seven pairs enrolled in a Programming Languages course. The findings indicate that there are significant behavioral learning sequences. During the program development process, students hesitated to create an algorithm and to improve an existing one while proposing the next step. In addition, they constantly waited for approval. Collaborative behaviors such as giving and receiving feedback and helping other partners were less observed in females. In addition, significant sequential driver and navigator behaviors were presented. The findings of the study have important implications for instructors and designers when using a pair programming approach in teaching programming. In the future, programming instruction environments can be designed by considering the learner behaviors that are presented in this study."

A typical technique for encouraging higher-order thinking is to use instructional design interventions that engage learners in simple cognitive activities. Business simulation game (BSG) is one of the types of interactive learning environments that can increase HOTS. In addition, student engagement and attitude toward technology use are considered strong influences on HOTS. The study explored the effect of using a BSG on HOTS and student engagement. It examined the influence of attitude toward the use of a BSG on HOTS and student engagement. The results of the t-test analysis showed that learning activities using BSG had a positive effect on HOTS and student engagement. Additionally, PLS-SEM analysis results indicated that immersion, interaction, and intention to use the game influence student engagement. Furthermore, student engagement significantly influenced HOTS. The findings indicate that students must demonstrate that they are engaging actively in a course to improve HOTS and that a BSG can be a valuable and effective tool for promoting engagement. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic caused limitations in sampling and representativeness of respondents. Future research should involve a bigger sample size and students who have attended related courses."

However, it remains a challenge for students to understand those abstract concepts when learning computer programming, implying the need to provide instant learning diagnosis and feedback in computer programming activities. In this study, a Two-Tier Test-Based Programming Training (T3PT) approach was proposed. Accordingly, an online learning system was developed to provide students with precision feedback for guiding them to identify misconceptions of computer programming to improve their computer programming learning achievement. In order to examine the effects of the proposed approach, a learning system was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. Two classes of 99 eighth-grade students from Taiwan were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used the learning system based on the T3PT approach, while the control group used the conventional learning system. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was significantly superior to the conventional programming learning approach in terms of students’ programming logic concepts, problem-solving awareness, technology acceptance, and satisfaction with the learning approach. Accordingly, discussion and suggestions are provided for future research."

This paper argues that the emergence of smart libraries have changed the paradigms of library by acknowledging the potential benefits and transformation smart library brings to library operations and services. It notes that analytical and computational thinking, data literacy, information literacy, social intelligence, programs and project management, cross-cultural competency, transliteracy, transdisciplinary, design thinking and mindset, virtual collaboration and cognitive load management are skills to be possessed by smart librarians. It highlights cloud computing, big data, 3D printing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, drones etc., as the emerging technologies used for smart libraries and further discusses smart services, smart people, smart places and smart governance as the dimensions of smart library. Revelations are further made that smart libraries aid space saving, expansion of library working hours and services and promotes access to information, while remarks are made that lack of technological know-how, technophobia, data privacy and security, etc., are the challenges of smart library. It concludes that the emergence of smart library have facilitated the redefinition of library services and operations and recommends amongst others that librarians should continuously update their skills so that they can meet up with competitions that may arise from the challenges of globalisation of the information landscape."

The data were collected from children’s essays, which were analyzed using qualitative content analysis. Results reveal that children’s learning experiences are often related to 21st-century core subjects and skills, but they also reported improved physical abilities and sports competences from digital games. Children felt that the skills they had gained were beneficial in the contexts of school, sports, and friendships. The results contribute to our understanding of digital games and children by providing children’s perspective on digital games and learning."

We surveyed the research literature and identified the techniques that are commonly used by instructors for teaching these courses. We observed that visual programming and game-based learning can enhance computational thinking and problem-solving skills in students and may be used to introduce them to programming. Robot programming may be used to attract students to programming, but the success of this technique is subjected to the availability of robots. Pair and collaborative programming allows students to learn from one another and write efficient programs. Assessment systems help instructors in evaluating programs written by students and provide them with timely feedback. Furthermore, an analysis of citations showed that Scratch is the most researched tool for teaching programming. We discuss how these techniques may be used to teach introductory courses, advanced courses, and massive open online courses on programming."

The curriculum, designed by the researchers and an elementary teacher, uses tangible tools, and emphasizes collaboration in solving daily problems. The MANOVA results revealed initial gender differences in AI knowledge. Following MANCOVA analysis showed significant improvements in AI knowledge, as well as perceptions and behavioral intentions toward AI, effectively bridging the observed knowledge gaps without any significant differences attributed to gender or initial knowledge levels. This evidence underscores the success of tangible and collaborative AI interventions in uniformly enhancing AI knowledge and positively changing perceptions and behavioral intentions among all participants, regardless of gender. Both female and non-binary students felt increased engagement and reduced anxiety toward AI, with improved comprehension and a preference for collaborative learning. This study contributes to the design of inclusive AI interventions, highlighting gender differences and including non-binary students as an essential part of the analysis."

A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts. Finally, this article shows how curriculum mapping can be implemented to embed employability skills progressively across a program sequence using a case study from the School of Music, University of Queensland."

A class of 27 in-service teachers studied a course “e-Learning in primary mathematics” was asked to reflect “what is e-Learning” before and after the course. Their concept of “e-Learning” was investigated by counting the matching key words using the text-mining system and a content analysis of learner-generated text using a rubric, respectively. The correlations of the results using these two methods were .823 and .840 in the preteaching and postteaching reflections. This text-mining system has the potential as a supporting tool for teachers to gain a general understanding of learner-generated text using the hierarchical visualization for supporting pedagogical decision-making, which can be applied to massive open online courses with a large enrolment of learners."

Moreover, their involvement and support are considered the key factor that facilitates an effective implementation of programming education at schools. This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument measuring parents’ perceptions of programming education among P-12 schools in Hong Kong. We propose that parents’ perceptions of programming education is a multidimensional construct which constitutes (a) understanding, (b) support, and (c) expectation. In total, 524 questionnaires were collected from the parents who attended programming workshops and seminars. Exploratory factor analysis shows evidence for the three-dimensional construct. Confirmatory factor analysis reconfirms the measurement structure. Implications of the study are discussed."

We embedded SRL support features into a performance-based assessment platform as scaffolding to help the students implement problem-solving strategies. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to evaluate the intervention. The students’ perceptions of their SRL skills after working through the programming tasks were measured by a survey of 45 students. The quantitative results suggested that the students benefited from the performance-based assessment platform in developing their SRL skills. A thematic analysis of interview data from 20 students further indicated that the embedded SRL scaffolding and automatic marking function helped them to solve the programming tasks. The results demonstrate that a well-designed performance-based assessment platform with embedded SRL support can be an effective tool for developing students’ SRL. The qualitative results further revealed that algorithmic thinking is an aspect of programming for which students need more SRL support.

To examine the learning strategies, we used aptitude treatment interaction for the learning model. Statistical analysis is used to examine the effect of this strategy and the students’ self-directed learning readiness on the learning outcomes. We found that students who are taught by online learning strategies based on fuzzy expert systems have better learning outcomes than students who are given traditional online learning strategies. Students who have high self-directed learning readiness have higher learning outcomes than students who have low self-directed learning readiness in both online learning strategies. Students who have low self-directed learning readiness are more appropriate to learn by the online learning strategies based on fuzzy expert systems to improve their learning outcomes"

But whenever automated processing like analysis, comparison or retrieval is intended, a formal definition is helpful. This should cover not only the syntactic structure, but also the semantics, i.e. the intended meaning, and thus adheres to the technique of mathematical remodelling of existing cultural phenomena. The resulting models can serve as a basis for automated processing, but also help to clarify the communication and discussion among humans substantially. This article proposes such a definition in four layers, which address different problems of encoding and communication: (a) relation of symbol sequences to staff positions, (b) combining functions, (c) chord roots, and (d) interval structure and voice leading. Only one of them is specific to functional (Riemannian) theory and can possibly be replaced to represent scale degree theory. The proposal is configurable to different interval specification methods and open to localisation. Syntax and semantics are defined by precise mathematical means, borrowed from computer science, and thus are unambiguously documented."

The results show that quality communication in the beginning phase of group development and health-care work experiences are two major factors associated with students’ perception of overall collaborative learning. The findings confirm the importance of the initial phase of collaboration. Faculty should deliberately design collaborative learning experiences that offer orientation in enhancing the interactions among group members and allow quality communication to proliferate.

These studies often result in large amounts of data produced and the objective is to generate meaningful interpretations from them. This can sometimes mean combining and integrating different datasets through data fusion techniques. The most strategic course of action when dealing with products of unknown profile is to use exploratory approaches. For omics, this means using untargeted analytical methods and exploratory data analysis techniques. The current study aimed to perform data fusion on untargeted multimodal (negative and positive mode) liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry data using multiple factor analysis. The data fusion results were interpreted using agglomerative hierarchical clustering on biplot projections. The study reduced the thousands of spectral signals processed to less than a hundred features (a primary parameter combination of retention time and mass-to-charge ratios, RT_m/z). The correlations between cluster members (samples and features from) were calculated and the top 10% highly correlated features were identified for each cluster. These features were then tentatively identified using secondary parameters (drift time, ion mobility constant and collision cross-section values) from the ion mobility spectra. These ion mobility (secondary) parameters can be used for future studies in wine chemical analysis and added to the growing list of annotated chemical signals in applied sciences."

Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts."

However, the teacher is an essential component of how the students engage with the technology, as they embed the IVE into everyday teaching and learning. Ideally, classroom pedagogies would reflect the scientific practices modeled in the IVE to the best extent possible. In this case study, we explore how one teacher enacted authentic scientific practices after 3 years of IVE implementations plus participation in the corresponding professional development (PD) experience. Although the teacher believed that the inquiry practices modeled in the IVE and the PD were an important part of his teaching, these beliefs were not transferred into practice. Our findings suggest that PD should include opportunities for teachers to reflect on their own practice integrating technology and consider external factors contributing to pedagogical change beyond PD."

Objectives: We investigated the relationship between maternal heat exposure and miscarriage (pregnancy ending before 20 weeks gestation) in a South African setting. Design: Population-based cohort study. Methods: Our study involved data for pregnancies collected via a health and demographic surveillance system in rural KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa between 2012 and 2016. Data from the South African Weather Service were used to compute maternal exposure to heat during the following time windows for each pregnancy: during the month preceding conception (T1) and during the week preceding the study outcome (either a miscarriage or no miscarriage, T2). Heat exposure was operationalized as a continuous variable and defined as the number of days that a mother was exposed to a mean daily temperature of > 26.6°C (A “hot day,” equivalent to a mean daily temperature of > 80°F) during T1 or T2. Binary logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between maternal heat exposure and miscarriage. Results: A total of 105/3477 pregnancies included in our analysis ended in miscarriage (3.0%). Each additional hot day during T1 was associated with a 26% higher odds of miscarriage (odds ratio: 1.26; 95% confidence interval: 1.15–1.38). No significant associations were observed between maternal heat exposure during T2 and the odds of miscarriage (odds ratio: 0.94, 95% confidence interval: 0.73–1.20). The relationship between maternal heat exposure during T1 and the odds of miscarriage was J-shaped. Conclusion: There is a clear relationship between maternal heat exposure during the month preceding conception and miscarriage in our sub-Saharan African setting. Given the lack of feasible strategies to reduce pregnancy loss associated with prevailing high temperatures in sub-Saharan Africa, progressive climate change will likely exacerbate existing challenges for women’s reproductive health in this region."

These questions are reflected in the frame of the recent discussion of human and machine learning. AI for learning provides many applications and multimodal channels for supporting people in cognitive and non-cognitive task domains. The articles in this special issue evidence that agency, engagement, self-efficacy, and collaboration are needed in learning and working with intelligent tools and environments. The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership. This special issue also highlights the concepts of explainability and explicability in the context of human learning. We need much more research and research-based discussion for making AI more trustworthy for users in learning environments and to prevent misconceptions."

Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games."

The Global Makerspace project was conducted over 4 days in the Autumn 2018. The schools’ participating teachers and pupils belonged to the first years of primary level. In this article, the Danish experiences from the project are explored. The data collection analysed draws on a micro-ethnographic study of the experiences from the Danish makerspace completed by the Danish facilitator from the project Makerspaces in the early years: Enhancing digital literacy and creativity. The article identifies the teachers’ and pupils’ maker activities out from a play cultural point of view and reckon making as connecting to describe how offline maker communities connected into one online maker community. The baseline of the school experiment was to explore and stress the potential of how communities like teachers and pupils across time and space in collaboration can transform and develop play cultures with different combinations of technologies by sharing local maker activities into global activities online."

This case study presents students’ opinions about their participation in a 3D multiuser game-like environment, by harnessing Second Life in combination with the two-dimensional (2D) programming environment of Scratch4SL. Following a blended instructional format (face-to-face in a computer laboratory and supplementary online courses), 56 students utilizing Scratch4SL participated in this study, with a view to reduce the “steep learning curve” created during their first-time entrance into Second Life. This study identifies Papert’s theory of Constructionism as a potentially appropriate theoretical foundation for the development of an instructional framework, in order to assist students to coordinate and manage learning materials with other teammates, using their computational thinking skills in collaborative problem-based programming tasks. The study findings based on a mixed-method research (a close-ended questionnaire and an open-ended interview) indicated the effectiveness of this “constructionist-oriented” instructional process for students’ engagement to acquire or empower social, cognitive, higher-order, and computational thinking skills. Educational implications and recommendations for future research are also discussed."

With known racial and gender biases in ML algorithms, we urge sociologists to (re)consider the implications of the widespread use of these technologies in our research. To illustrate this point, we use two popular ML algorithms, ClarifAI and Kairos, to code a small sample of sociologists (n = 167) and their coauthors (n = 1,664) and compare their findings to the sociologists’ hand-coded race and gender information. We further explore ML-generated differences by analyzing the extent of racial homophily in these sociologists’ collaboration networks. We find significant differences across the three coding methods that would lead to very different conclusions and future research agendas. We conclude by elaborating on how sociologists might ethically consider the role of ML and its use in the discipline."

This study explored one aspect of CS teachers’ understanding of student misconceptions: their perceptions of student misconceptions related to introductory programming. Perceptions in this study included three parts: teachers’ perceived frequency of a student misconception, teachers’ perceived importance of a misconception in learning, and teachers’ confidence in addressing a misconception. Teachers in our study taught a Python-based CS course for high schools students. A survey was designed and administered to assess teachers’ perceptions of students’ misconceptions. Our results indicated that teachers’ confidence of addressing misconceptions and the teaching context may affect their perceptions of student misconceptions. We also found that some latent misconceptions are likely to lead to a perception of low frequency as they can be more difficult to detect. Moreover, our study found that teachers’ degrees and additional computing training showed positive relationships with their confidence of addressing student misconceptions and that additional computing training also showed a positive relationship with teachers’ perceived importance of student misconceptions. Implications of the findings for future research and practice of CS education are discussed."

In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly low-income, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semi-structured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls’ self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation."

This article discusses the benefits to students of introducing CDS into the university curriculum with a focus on developing skills in cheminformatics, data analysis, structure–activity relationships, modelling and simulation. Moreover, CDS can enable students to engage with complex chemical and toxicological data in new and dynamic ways, helping them to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential hazards and risks associated with different chemicals and substances. On the other hand, it can foster greater collaboration between students and faculty and with external partners in industry and government. This can lead to the development of more effective and efficient toxicological testing methods and tools to screen chemicals for potential hazards and aid the development of environmentally friendly chemicals. Overall, the integration of CDS into the university curriculum will help prepare the next generation of scientists giving them a competitive edge to make considerable contributions to green chemistry, designing safer chemicals and non-animal testing methods. It will enable them to tackle modern challenges facing society including identifying safer and more sustainable chemicals and predicting the health and environmental impacts of novel chemical substances."

The purpose of the study is to examine why this occurred, and the authors looked at the teachers’ modeling discourse. Using two theories to connect to practice (terministic screens, and schema theory), the authors collected data via the surveys, interviews, and email reflections. The authors analyzed the results via coding to explore participants’ concept of models and the potential difficulties of implementing computer modeling in their classrooms. Findings show that the term model was interpreted differently by the PD’s faculty team and participants. Further, the authors found that the majority of presenters held differing theories of models than the participants. Participant concepts of models did improve slightly after the PD, but lingering model concepts caused confusion with the anticipated PD results. Conclusions include five general modeling concepts which are presented and explained. Implications are provided showcasing articulated keys for delivering PD that assists in eliminating discursive and theoretical issues. Included are considerations for STEM teacher educators, PD providers, and K-12 teachers. The main study limitations include mixed K-12 teaching participants, distance between participants, a self-selected population, and non-generalizable findings based on qualitative work. Future directions are outlined."

Drawing upon a 6-year study of the Toronto Star, this article provides an account of TOPS, an in-house web content management system which served as the backbone of thestar.com for 6 years. For some, TOPS was a successful software innovation, while for others, a strategic digital ‘property’. But for most journalists, it was slow, deficient in functionality, aesthetically unappealing and cumbersome. Although several organizational factors can explain TOPS’ obstinacy, I argue for particular attention to the complex ontology of software. Based on an outline of this ontology, I suggest software be taken seriously as an object of journalism, which implies acknowledging its partial autonomy from human use or authorization, accounting for its ability to mutate indefinitely and analysing its capacity to encourage forms of ‘computational thinking’."

Comparing artistic production and hybrid techniques with generative AI, we will discuss topics of Computational Creativity in art, industrial design, and architecture. The programmable meshes solution, combined with hybrid fabrication processes, enables an incredible variety of complex forms, stimulates artistic creativity, and provides flexible feedback to bypass some Digital Fabrication issues. Our findings also elucidate the importance of original technology development and cultural identity in fostering creative and culturally inclusive technologies for art and education."

But what does it look like to “get started” on CSed for a whole district? This manuscript presents a single case study of a district’s process of initiating their CS instructional initiative, highlighting a distinct set of instructional leadership practices and the institutional conditions they were responding to. Early implementation research around CSed shows that in some districts, leadership practices are less often the focus of early activities. This study sheds light on what such leadership practices can look like in the early stages of a district’s CSed initiative. Our analysis, based on qualitative data collected longitudinally over 18 months of the district’s work, identified eight intertwined leadership practices that aimed to support instructional coherence, and in our findings, we share a narrative of the district’s initiation of its CS initiative around them. The case begins with the (1) initial leadership team formation and details how that team engaged in (2) content-specific instructional capacity building for its members and (3) sensemaking of ideas around CS with their relationship to existing district activities. It moves on to the team’s (4) development of an instructional vision and an (5) associated implementation strategy, which fed into processes of (6) sensegiving to foster buy-in among teachers, and providing encouragement to engage in (7) instructional piloting. Finally, leaders engaged in (8) landscape analysis activities in order to understand existing district resources and teacher perceptions related to CS. Throughout the case, we highlight the motivations behind these practices, what resources they drew on, intersections, and dependencies among them. We close our analysis exploring a number of tensions and unintended consequences associated with these leadership activities."

Many studies have shown that this has significantly led to the change in cognition of design environments in academia. Design decisions are made through a recursive process that is cyclically refined by allowing constant feedback and testing. This paper represents an observational study with an aim to understand the impact of digital mediums on design processes and design outcomes focusing on associative modeling using VPL. It contextualizes the difference, the associative modeling system as a parametric subset brings to design thinking when used as a medium to explore architectural design. It analyzes specific attributes of associative modeling, otherwise native to computational thinking, that contribute to the legibility of the design process. The paper demonstrates how associative modeling allows the design process to be examined and edited at any stage during and even after algorithmic development, bringing in flexibility. It is argued that digital design tool affordances enable students to develop multilayered and more structured design logic that augments cognition bringing more legibility to the design thinking process."

Over the course of 3 weeks, participants in these four groups were asked to solve programming problems using Python with WOE and metacognitive scaffolding. The results demonstrate that the provision of metacognitive scaffolding with faded WOE (FWM) is the most effective for problem-solving programming and self-regulation skills. In addition, an interaction effect exists between the two treatments for the germane load in FWM. Therefore, results in this study provide empirical insights into ways to effectively apply WOE and metacognitive scaffolding to problem-solving processes for programming-based complex problem-solving, especially for novice learners."

Sixty-seven undergraduate students in a computer programing fundamentals course were randomly assigned into one of two groups: (1) experimental group (N = 34; received self-regulated learning support) and (2) control group (N = 33). Participants in both groups were asked to solve programing problems using Python over 3 weeks, and their cognitive load levels were measured after each week. The results showed that novice learners’ self-regulated learning skills can be influenced by learning support, which contributes to solving complex problems. The results also suggest that, given the sequence of tasks (i.e., basic and advanced well-structured and ill-structured problems), self-regulated learning support may require time to be effective. The germane load of the experimental group was higher for well-structured problems than that of the control group. Using logistic regression, the two groups were differentiated through different variables measured in this study, which showed a high predictive explanatory power. The results provide implications for designing self-regulated learning support for programing courses, using problem-based learning in association with problem-solving skills, self-regulated learning skills, and cognitive load management."

Instead of focusing on film and fashion as means of visual representation, the author relies on the concept of inscription for a better understanding of both cinema (as recording of light and movement) and textile (with its various thread techniques of weaving, stitching, knitting, etc.)."

The results indicated experience level and collaboration interventions can have impacts on students. Assigned Group Roles had positive effects on students’ motivation and collaborative problem-solving. Experience level also had effects upon student learning motivation and collaborative problem-solving with the Novice status associated with higher levels as compared with students who had more experience. A collaboration intervention was identified that has the potential to produce positive effects for students in collaborative robotics projects as well as assist classroom educators in the purposeful design of collaborative robotics projects with scientifically based strategies to improve the attitudinal outcomes for students of various robotics experience."

We provide a comprehensive overview of the identification of learning strategies in the existing literature, the design and development of preliminary questionnaire items, the refinement of item wording, and the examination of the internal structure and reliability of the final instrument. The construction of the items was based on the educational theory of Self-Regulated Learning. The final version of the questionnaire, called the Computer Programming Learning Strategies Questionnaire (CEAPC), was administered to 647 students enrolled in computer programming courses. The data collected from the participants were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The CEAPC consists of 13 subscales, each corresponding to a different type of learning strategy, and a total of 89 items. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that the CEAPC has adequate construct validity. In addition, the results of the internal consistency analysis indicate satisfactory reliability across the different subscales of the instrument. This study contributes to the field of educational research, particularly in the area of self-regulated learning in computer programming."

The proposed model showed that perceived competence and game attitude were the main predictors of enjoyment, while no direct relationship was found between perceived competence and gaming achievement. The model simultaneously considered other factors such as prior game experience and intensity of use, and final analysis revealed that these two variables were directly related. Another important finding was the strong impact of prior game experience on perceived competence. Results are interpreted with reference to implications for possible means of improving learning outcomes when using mobile learning games in the academic context."

This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students’ learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students’ responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study."

To assess students’ design thinking disposition, this study developed the Design Thinking Disposition Scale (DTDS) with a sample of 350 junior high school students who had computer programming experience in a STEAM course. A principle axis factor analysis with the promax rotation method was used to verify the DTDS’s construct under the four dimensions: empathize, define, ideate and prototype. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .90 for the overall scale. Correlation analyses results showed that all the four dimensions were significantly correlated with computer programming self-efficacy assessed by CPSES. A significant regression model was found in which the three factors, ideate, prototype and define, significantly predicted the overall computer programming self-efficacy. Meanwhile, except for the ideate subscale, no gender difference was found in the young students’ design thinking dispositions. The students’ self-directed programming learning experience was shown to benefit their design thinking disposition. The DTDS can be applied to design-thinking-embedded computer literacy curricula such as makers, STEAM, or robotics education. Several further studies are also suggested."

To understand young students’ perceptions about their own learning in computer programming, this study aimed to develop an instrument, Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSES), for all students above middle school levels. Based on Berland and Lee’s computational thinking framework, this study developed the CPSES items at a literacy level and finally the instrument included the five subscales: Logical Thinking, Algorithm, Debug, Control, and Cooperation. An exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests were conducted in this study. The reliability alpha was .96 for the overall scale, and ranged from .84 to .96 for the subscales. This study also confirmed the positive correlation between computer programming experience and computer programming self-efficacy. In addition, for low- and middle-experienced learners, significant gender differences were found in two subscales: Algorithm and Debug. The CPSES can be applied as an evaluation tool in computer education, robotics education, as well as integrated STEM or STEAM education in which computer programming was regarded as a part of computer literacy."

Based on Bloom’s Taxonomy of educational objectives, this study aimed to develop the Robotics Learning Self-Efficacy Scale (RLSES) with a two-level construct of five dimensions for assessing students’ self-efficacy for learning robotics. A total of 181 elementary, junior high and senior high school students (5th–12th graders) with robotics learning experience were selected as the sample of this study. A questionnaire including 32 candidate items designed for the initial version of the RLSES was administered to the sample. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted and, finally, 16 items were drawn for the final RLSES under five subscales (Comprehension, Practice, Analysis, Application, and Collaboration), with a total explained variance of 85.28%. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .97 for the overall scale, ranging from .87 to .95 for the subscales. The inter-correlation analysis showed evidence of discriminant validity. Regression analysis results supported that Practice and Comprehension self-efficacy were significant predictors of Analysis, Application, and Collaboration self-efficacy, confirming the two-level (2 × 3) construct of the RLSES. Significant differences among school levels were found and are discussed."

In this study, online CAD-based learning experiences structured with the Tinkercad Circuits Platform designed for gifted students were investigated based on the opinions of students regarding the distance education activity and the evaluations of the students’ scientific writing skills. This study used a single case holistic design with 10 gifted 6th-grade students at Usak Science and Art Center in Türkiye. All of the students stated that they had not previously encountered an activity such as the “smart air conditioning system”. The students also stated that although the activity was carried out in the form of distance education, it was positive and fun to be application-based, and that it was fun to research, discuss, design, and code with Tinkercad to look for a solution to the given problem. The evaluation of students’ products showed participants’ high level of proficiency in activities requiring advanced problem-solving skills, including planning the solution to the problem, creating an alternative plan for the solution, realizing, and evaluating the design."

The instructional design of the tool followed scaffolding design guidelines, reciprocal teaching model, and principles of multimedia design. The training provided metacognitive reading strategy instruction to improve reading comprehension through multiple strategies using multiple texts. The participants were 87 college students studying English as a Foreign Language (EFL) at an English medium university in Turkey. At pretest, the control group had scored significantly higher in reading comprehension based on a standardized measure. Both of the experimental groups significantly improved their reading comprehension and metacognitive strategy awareness, while the control group’s reading and engagement scores decreased. The in-class experimental group also improved on the engagement scale. No significant difference was found between the experimental groups or compared to the control group in reading comprehension. The findings have implications regarding institutional policies for teaching reading in EFL and online reading strategy design at the tertiary level."

However, it remains a challenge to improve students’ learning achievement and engagement in environmental education. Researchers have pointed out the potential of digital games for promoting students’ learning motivation. In addition, the two-tier testing mechanism has been recognized as an effective tool for correcting students’ misconceptions and promoting their in-depth thinking. Therefore, this study proposed a two-tier testing-based digital gaming approach. To verify the effectiveness of the approach, a digital game was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. The participants were two classes of fifth graders, with one class as the experimental group using the two-tier test-based digital game and the other class as the control group learning with the conventional digital game. The results showed that the digital game-based learning with two-tier testing model was conducive to students’ improved academic performance compared with the conventional digital game-based learning model, especially for students in the low-level group, who were able to make greater progress. In addition, the approach was effective in terms of reducing students’ cognitive load and improving their flow experience."

In this article, we explore the relationship between computer science (CS) concepts and students’ multimodal expression in a coding animated narrative (CAN) task in the context of an integrated English-Technology unit of learning. Through this collective case study, we explore how CS concepts underpin semiotic elements of an animated narrative, analyse the factors that influence the extent to which students exercise those concepts, and reveal the tensions and opportunities that a CAN task may present for learning computer science concepts in regular, non-specialist, cross-curricular classrooms. The findings suggest that CAN tasks are unique in presenting opportunities for students to learn challenging CS concepts such as synchronisation and parallelism. At the same time, CAN tasks present tensions for teaching CS concepts in non-specialist classrooms, where student projects are often judged on their visual qualities. In such settings, procedural, rather than conceptual knowledge, may be a more efficient route to creative outcomes. It also means that drawing skills need to be prioritised. Role specialisation often led to better quality projects but at the expense of individual students’ conceptual development in computer science."

It aims to improve students’ reasoning of spatiotemporal variation by utilizing sequential shapeshifting of patterns. This article examines the outcomes of this educational research from a perspective of design computing with a purpose to remark its pedagogical significance. A multilayered reading about the exercise will reveal its historical, theoretical, and artistic backgrounds. Then the common structural elements and different construction approaches are explained along with a novel design and analysis method. The proposed method embeds variations of two-dimensional pattern deformations on a third dimension. It enables various analyses such as the measurement of regularity and locating the attractor points. This study is expected to exemplify how computational thinking and new digital tools change the way designers would approach to such systematic compositions."

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence and new theoretical perspectives on the mechanisms of interaction between CT and MT. To address this research gap, this study analyses the participants’ thinking processes in solving programming-based mathematical problems from a flexibility perspective, focusing on the interplay between computational and mathematical thinking, that is, how CT and MT work together to influence and determine the problem-solver’s choice of solution strategy. Using data collected from a large design-based study, we summarise two types of flexibility and six subtypes of flexibility demonstrated by participants in the programming-based mathematical problem-solving process using thematic analysis. These different types of flexibility provide researchers and mathematics educators with new theoretical perspectives to examine the interplay of CT and MT. Findings will also contribute toward student learning characteristics in programming-based mathematical problem-solving to sketch the big picture of how CT and MT emerge in complementary or mismatching ways."

However, several robotics learning centers have introduced robotics education in an informal setting. This research paper aims to highlight the essence of robotics education in Uzbekistan investigating the perception of parents and children to their full potential and identifying impediments to the process of implementing robotics in Uzbekistan. This research study involves primary and secondary research methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the reflection of robotics education among primary and secondary school children. Official statistical data was gathered to prove the scope of demographics. Primary data was collected through the survey among parents whose children attended robotics classes. Ultimately, the authors have used empirical evidence to provide recommendations and solutions on how to implement robotics education effectively in Uzbekistan. Much emphasis has not been put on robotics education in Uzbekistan, despite reforms in the field of STEM education. Moreover, the condition (including teachers, lesson materials, classrooms, computers, and robotics kits) to implement robotics classes as more developed countries are doing has not been created properly, which hampers the introduction of robotics at schools. In addition, the majority of parents are not fully aware of the authentic value of robotics education in children’s lives. Hence, Uzbek schools are lagging in the field of robotics."

Studies have pointed out that in robotics courses, learners face challenges in learning abstract content, such as constructing a robot with a good structure and writing programs to drive a robot to complete specific learning tasks. The present study proposed the embodied learning-based computer programming approach and applied it to the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics course. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in one public primary school to explore its effects on students’ learning achievement, learning motivation, learning attitudes, learning engagement, and cognitive load. The experimental group (40 students) adopted the embodied learning-based computer programming approach, while the control group (40 students) adopted the conventional computer programming approach. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement in robotics than the control group, and that there was no significant difference in the cognitive load of the two groups. In terms of learning motivation, although both groups showed improvement, the experimental group had higher intrinsic learning motivation. In addition, the experimental group outperformed the control group with regard to learning attitudes and learning engagement (including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement). Accordingly, this study could contribute to future research for developing more effective robotics teaching approaches and computer programming activity design."
