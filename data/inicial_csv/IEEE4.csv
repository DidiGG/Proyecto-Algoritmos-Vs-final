In response to the growing computational intensity of the healthcare industry, biomedical engineering (BME) undergraduate education is starting to emphasize computation and computational thinking. Computational thinking is a way of thinking that uses concepts and methodologies of computing to solve problems in interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary subjects. In broader terms, computational thinking is not only associated with using computational tools but also with the thought process of solving a problem by data representation, problem decomposition, and algorithm design. Despite being so important, there is little research work or information available on the development of computational thinking in BME undergraduate students. Our research focuses on how BME undergraduate students develop computational thinking skills while performing group activities related to problem-solving. In order to conduct this study, we incorporate a teaching methodology that prompts computational thinking in a thermodynamics course being taught at a public mid-western university to approximately 120 sophomore students. We observe classroom activities involving analytical problem solving followed by pseudo code generation for computational coding. In order to investigate computational thinking, we collect classroom observations of small groups of students as they come up with a solution to an analytical problem with each other. We complement the observation notes of the classroom activities with follow up semi structured interviews with individual students from five groups. Thematic analysis of the student interviews is used in order to analyze student responses towards the incorporation of computation intensive teaching methodology. This Work in Progress helps us expand our understanding of computational thinking development and the challenges involved in performing computational thinking activity in BME undergraduate students.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028503","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028503","thermodynamics;computational thinking","Mathematical model;Thermodynamics;Interviews;Problem-solving;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Testing","","2","","11","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is generally accepted that Programming is a complex task that requires a long learning process. Theoretical knowledge about fundamentals on algorithms and data structures, as well as, on programming languages are required but are not enough; practicing a lot is also necessary. However, teaching Computer Programming is a hard job, most of the times unsuccessful. To overcome all the difficulties, felt by teachers and students, an increasingly bigger community of researchers in Computer Science is defending the importance of teaching Computational Thinking to young students to train them, since very earlier, in logic and abstract reasoning for problem solving. Our starting point to approach this topic relies on the use of an Ontology (OntoCnE) that describes in detail the concepts “Computational Thinking” and “Programming”, and maps those concepts to different education levels, starting with the first year. We believe that a person just acquires a new way of thinking, or a new way of behaving, if he is trained with the appropriate learning resources. So a main investment to educate people in Computational Thinking is on the choice/creation of those convenient resources. In particular we intended to investigate the impact of Augmented Reality in the usefulness of the referred resources. In that direction we will also discuss the development of a Web Platform to help on collecting and classifying (according to the referred ontology) learning resources to be used by teachers in computing classes. On the other hand, the platform will help on the retrieval, from that repository, of the most adequate resources to teach a specific subject to a specific level.","","978-1-7281-3182-5","10.1109/SIIE48397.2019.8970131","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8970131","computational thinking;programming;learning resource;teacher support tools;ontology","","","6","","15","IEEE","28 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The exhibit was designed to help children learn about engineering careers and CT, and provides different learning activities to elicit CT in children from diverse learning groups. The exhibit provides information about different engineering disciplines/fields, and examples of engineers from diverse groups (i.e. it includes images of people of different races, ethnicities, gender, and ability).In this study, we audio- and video-recorded families while they explored the exhibit. They then participated in interviews and completed surveys. The video data provided evidence that children can engage in a range of CT competencies in the computer-supported coding game. Our findings can help us further consider how families can support children as they learn CT skills in out-of-school environments.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8659268","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8659268","Computational Thinking;Out-of-School;Engineering Education","Encoding;Games;Computed tomography;Robots;Animals;STEM","","4","","23","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is widely agreed that in order to benefit and thrive in a digital world, more than digital literacy is required. Computational thinking promises understanding of information technology and its utilization without necessarily knowing how to write code. According to many authors, skills in computational thinking include the ability to evaluate and design solutions to problems. However, the vision for computational thinking, laid out by a number of scholars, is even bigger than this. It proposes that thinking habits from computer science are beneficial for any kind of problem solving and that those thinking habits form a central part of modern sciences. It might be that components of computational thinking are indeed useful in problem solving and that they play an important part in other sciences. However, computer science combines three types of thinking traditions: theoretical (mathematical) tradition, engineering tradition and scientific tradition, and it is important to differentiate between what is an aspect in one or more of these traditions and what is unique for computer science. This clarification will support the application and teaching of computational thinking. This paper explores the uniqueness of computational thinking and its roots in theoretical, engineering and scientific traditions of computing.","2623-8764","978-953-233-098-4","10.23919/MIPRO.2019.8756712","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8756712","Computational thinking;Computer science education;CSER;Computational ideas;History of computational thinking;Disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing","","","2","","35","","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, people's way of thinking must be able to follow the technology evolution. Since 2006, Computational Thinking (CT) has been stated as a fundamental skill for everyone, not just for computer scientists. The concept of CT is very important to be taught to children so that it can be applied as early as possible. In the digital era that is happening now, the suitable CT learning for children is in the form of digital game as an application on smartphones. The interaction and interface of this application is designed using user-centered design approach in ISO 9241210:2010. In order to make this application useful for children, it should be effective to use, easy to learn, and enjoyable. Those three things are the usability and user experience goals of this application. Usability testing is conducted to validate the achievement of the goals by using several metrics, such as completion rate, Single Ease Question (SEQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), and Intrinsic Motivation Inventory for interest/enjoyment subscale. The completion rate is 97,4 %/100% for usability goal effective to use, the SEQ score is 6,12/7 and the SUS score is 70,5/100 for usability goal learnability, and the IMI interest/enjoyment subscale score is 6,02/7 for user experience goal enjoyable. This application has achieved the usability and user experience goals because all the scores from the measurements using those four metrics are above the average.","","978-1-7281-8038-0","10.1109/ICAICTA49861.2020.9429049","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9429049","interaction design;computational thinking;game;user-centered design;prototype;usability testing","Measurement;User centered design;Prototypes;Games;User interfaces;User experience;Usability","","1","","18","IEEE","19 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study provides evidence of the effectiveness of teaching C++ (a low-level programming language) to develop computational thinking in high school students in Chile. By applying a test before and after a voluntary C++ workshop, the results reveal a significant improvement in computational thinking after the workshop. However, we observe that there was a tendency to drop out of the workshop among students with lower levels of initial computational thinking. Besides, tenth-grade students obtained lower final scores than eleventh and twelfth-grade students.

Also, data gathered from teacher and instructor interaction at multiple sites during the summer STEM professional development program contributed to the courses' design. The CS Methods course targeted undergraduate computer science majors who were considering a career in teaching or who were interested in CS pedagogy. We encountered several challenges recruiting and retaining students and found that computer science students attracted to teaching careers do not fall into the stereotype of most computer science majors. Participation of women was higher than the average undergraduate CS courses. A disconnect appeared between the pedagogical practices promoted for teaching computing at the high school level and those being practiced at the college level. After learning about the 5E pedagogical model for teaching computing, students expressed interest in the potential of using more student-centered instruction, not only for high school instruction, but also for their own college courses. An area of disconnect also emerged in the programming formats, as all the students were comfortable with Java but all were unfamiliar with popular block-based programming platforms, such as Scratch.

Computational thinking has been acknowledged as a key aspect of engineering education and an intrinsic part of multiple ABET outcomes. However, computing is an area where some students have more privileges (e.g. access and exposure to meaningful use of computers) than others. Integrating computing into engineering, especially early in the curriculum, may exacerbate existing experiential disadvantages students from excluded social identities experience. Most introductory engineering programs have a component of programming and/or computational thinking. A comprehensive literature review showed that no existing computational thinking framework fully met the needs of students and professors in engineering and computer science. As a result, this team created the Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic (ECTD). This diagnostic was assessed and improved during the 2019-2020 academic year. Data was collected from a cohort in a first-year engineering course that included topics in mathematics, engineering problem solving, and computation. Pre- and post-test data analysis with 62 participants documents statistically significant student growth in computational thinking in this course. Significant differences were not found by gender or a limited racially-based analysis. This diagnostic is of interest and relevance to all institutions providing engineering and computing programs. The short-term impact of this research includes an innovative approach to gauge student abilities in computational thinking early in a course in order to add appropriate intervention activities into lesson plans. The long-term impact is the creation of a measurement of student learning of computational thinking in engineering for courses and programs that wish to develop this important skill in their students.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274250","National Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274250","computational thinking;first-year engineering education;learning and teaching effectiveness;assessment metrics","Programming profession;Organizations;Engineering students;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Tools;Pattern matching","","5","","39","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this sense, Computational Thinking, as a problem-solving approach that can involve information technologies, can contribute a lot to this subject. Therefore, due to its essence, the development of Computer Science concepts is closely related to the employment of problem-solving activities. However, teachers may face difficulties when proposing Computational Thinking problem-solving activities to their students. This paper proposes the engineering of a software that aims to allow teachers to generate challenges related to game and interactive animations programming to support their classes. The problems generated by the system, do not limit the learners' creative power. Besides that, teachers can balance the reasoning component of the challenges according to the learners' level of knowledge in programming and algorithms.

Also, a topic that is growing within education is Computational Thinking, which says that the thinking like computer scientists is necessary for the 21st century and should be disseminated mainly in schools during basic education. In the face of this, this work created an augmented reality android application that tracks physical tiles and creates 3D maps for the user, also giving a character that can be programmed to walk on this created map, simulating a programming toy. Finally, tests carried out with the application have shown that augmented reality currently has performance problems when multiple targets are used, so, devices with low processing have problems at map tracking. These issues affected the tests with the children, which made it difficult for them to track the map like they wanted, but they still liked the app even after it. That shows that the acceptance of the technology by the children is good, which can help developing Computational Thinking, but the technology limitation is still a problem. These obstacles while currently hindering the use of augmented reality in education may in the future be irrelevant due to the constant advancement of technology. This paper's main contribution is showing one possibility of using AR with Computational Thinking and what needs to evolve for it to be used by the usable by the children.","","978-1-7281-5434-3","10.1109/SVR.2019.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8921049","Computational Thinking;Augmented Reality;Technology in Education","Augmented reality;Education;Target tracking;Programming profession;Rendering (computer graphics);Androids","","5","","10","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet, there is a consensus that CS has serious conundrums particularly in attracting students, low motivation for learning computer programming and developing computational thinking (CT) skills. New motivational methods are needed to take the attention of students and adapt to their learning patterns as how people learn have changed drastically over the last two decades. To address these issues, video games and video game-based tools are proposed as a primary approach for motivating and supporting students in developing their skills in CT and support their learning of introductory programming. This research is concerned with the capture of statistical evidence on the educational effectiveness of playing a serious game specifically designed to enhance the development of CT skills to facilitate learning introductory computer programming. A total of 190 students were invited to participate in a quasi-experimental pre-post study for the purpose of analyzing the impact of an adhoc game on students' confidence in learning programming constructs and using their skills in CT. All students were studying a CS degree at the time and they were all registered to a first-year computer programming course. 151 out of 190 students successfully completed the study and the findings suggest that a) the intrinsic motivation to learn programming; b) students' perception of their knowledge and their tangible knowledge in key programming constructs (i.e. programming sequence, methods, decision making and loops); and c) students' confidence in using their CT skills were all statistically and significantly improved after playing the game. Additionally, students perceived computer programming significantly less difficult in their post study responses when compared to their pre study responses.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3043278","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286386","Computational thinking;serious games;computer programming;video game design;game-based learning;gamification","Programming profession;Games;Visualization;Tools;Syntactics;Education;Computer languages","","29","","98","CCBY","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Computational thinking is a problem solving process that, at first sight, has not much to do with language learning. However, as demanded by Jeannette Wing in 2006, it should be taught to everyone like reading, writing and mathematics. By introducing computational thinking in language lessons e.g. through modeling we could ""kill two birds with one stone"": On the one hand, we can teach computational thinking and basics of computer science at all school levels even if there is no related subject, e.g. in primary schools. On the other hand, computational thinking tools like modeling can support language learning in different ways and help to train text comprehension, to acquire and elaborate vocabulary or to visualize grammar rules etc. This paper describes some creative possibilities of introducing computational thinking through modeling in language lessons in primary and secondary education.

Digital games are increasingly a part of our daily lives and are already considered teaching and learning tools. However, its production and documentation is a very complicated task that requires programming skills and knowledge from different areas. This has hampered the development of games in the classroom environment. On the other hand, some teachers have proposed this activity to enable their students to learn school content in a more meaningful way and, consequently, improve learning rates. An alternative for the adoption of game-based learning is an unplugged approach for creating games based on natural language, in which students learn the fundamentals of computing in a playful way and without the use of computers. In this context, this article presents an approach that proposes the creation of games in an unplugged way by using texts produced by students, thus favoring the development of computational thinking and reading and writing skills in the classroom. Also, it may support the students' interest in the computing area by motivating them to enter a higher education course or pursue a career in that area. The results of the exploratory study show that the proposed approach can favor the development of computational thinking, as well as motivate the production of texts, developing students' reading and writing skills, therefore contributing to the improvement of learning assessments.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274065","computational thinking;reading and writing skills;game design;unplugged","Games;Production;Writing;Education;Computers;Tools;Mathematics","","4","","61","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our project prepares in-service and pre-service elementary teachers to integrate CT into their science lessons. While our overall goal was to increase CT access for all students, we found some teachers enacted CT in ways that did not always provide equal access to all students. Although our professional development adopted a CS for All approach, without explicit supports, a group of teachers implemented CT in ways often upholding the current trends of inequity and power structures within CS.

In this paper, we use the concept of identities-in-practice as an analytical frame to examine how girls of color engage in computational thinking practices. Our research investigates how the identities of girls of color can be leveraged as funds of knowledge in learning spaces and asks the following research question: How does centering the identities of girls of color impact their engagement with computational thinking practices? We provide a program overview of CompuGirls, describe our curricular design approach, and share results from pilot implementations of the program offered at public libraries in Michigan, Arizona, and California. Results from our pilot year demonstrate that integrating identity exploration into a computational thinking curriculum results in a mutually reinforcing relationship where girls of color experience reflective identity development while simultaneously increasing their understanding of computational thinking. We present our approach as a promising avenue for connecting computing knowledge and skills to girls' identities and lived experiences. By focusing on the girls' identities, the program re-imagines computational experiences by fostering interactions with computational thinking from a personal perspective. Ultimately, we argue that centering girls' identities should be viewed as an integral part of the learning process and not tangential.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272507","computing education;computational thinking;gender","Libraries;Color;Cultural differences;Education;Programming profession;Image color analysis;Focusing","","1","","41","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The intention of getting access to a system or website or server can be born out of multiple threat groups and can be classified into common security threats. This paper looks at a persona-based approach to identify user groups that can be a threat to a system and how we can use the concepts of Design Thinking to model the system and protect it from possible security breaches.

As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2987254","Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry, and Competitiveness (Access@City)(grant numbers:TIN2016-78103-C2-2-R); Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation, and Universities(grant numbers:RTI2018-098156-B-C54); Co-Financed by FEDER funds (MINECO/ FEDER/UE); EduTech Project; Erasmus+Programme of the European Union(grant numbers:609785-EPP-1-2019-1-ES-EPPKA2-CBHE-JP); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9063433","Programming;computational thinking;problem-solving;career development;technology social factors;observational study","Programming profession;Training;Instruments;Psychology;Information systems;Problem-solving","","22","","39","CCBY","10 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272487","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272487","inquiry-based learning;computer science;computational thinking;multilingual;English learners","Computer science;Education;Standards;Linguistics;Statistics;Sociology;Interviews","","8","","42","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit.

In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15.

Assessment of short and long/essay answers is hectic and tedious tasks for several teachers. Learning Management Systems provide an opportunity to learn online. To develop critical thinking in an online environment, it is necessary to conduct exams and assessment online. Most online LMS tools support assessment through multiple choice questions, but these tools test only higher order thinking skills. Many researchers have tried to provide a system to automatically assess short and long/essay answers using several different approaches. The objective of survey is to highlight problems associated with the evaluator, discuss difficulties and limitations of online tools. In this literature, the methodologies used to develop various models of short answer grading given by several authors and their results are discussed.

The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions. The effectivity of Pic2Program on learning CT has been evaluated by a designed course for 9th, graders.

Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2019.2925253","Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada(grant numbers:RES0034954); Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Killam Trusts(grant numbers:RES0043207); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8760527","Computational thinking;computing skills;educational technology;higher education;pre-service teachers;problem solving;programming;topic modeling","Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Problem-solving;Education;Tools;Encoding;Data mining","","20","","60","IEEE","12 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning.

In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.","2168-6750","","10.1109/TETC.2017.2734818","Region of Madrid(grant numbers:S2013/ICE-2715); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7999170","Programming;computational thinking;learning paths;data-driven;Scratch","Programming profession;Tools;Education;Games;Computational modeling","","33","","43","IEEE","1 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD.

The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the “big ideas” of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency.

Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning.

The poster presentation will focus on the first of CT Pathways’ three research questions: How do individual participating League districts define the purpose (“the why”) of CS and CT education, and how do these individual rationales subsequently inform respective district’s intention to offer their students more equitable access to CS/CT content (“the how”)? Results will be reported via baseline pre-survey results from district administrators as well as through follow-up interviews/discussions with select district leads.

Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students.

This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.","1548-0992","","10.1109/TLA.2018.8358673","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8358673","autism spectrum disorders;computational thinking;game design workshop;neurodiversity","Autism;Guidelines;Games;Conferences;IEEE transactions;Organizations;Bibliographies","","3","","","IEEE","14 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since the introduction of workable DL, numerous success stories have been widely reported: board games, autonomous driving vehicles, natural language translation, voice recognition, etc. However, for machines to exhibit a high degree of intelligence, they need more than the ability to learn. Indeed, heavy reliance on ML has resulted in widely publicized mishaps that negatively affect people in unexpected ways. For healthcare and other mission-critical applications, intelligent machines need to perform dependably to earn and maintain the trust of human users. To this end, it is necessary to take a holistic view toward AI, one that encompasses multiple facets of what constitutes intelligence. Specifically, this paper previews what thinking machines would be capable of by taking into consideration a machine's ability to abstract and reason, in addition to its ability to learn.","","978-1-6654-0460-0","10.1109/SBBS50483.2020.9314935","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9314935","artificial intelligence;knowledge representation;machine intelligence;machine learning;machine thinking;reasoning system;semantic computing;telehealth","Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Medical services;Intelligent agents;Software algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Games","","","","14","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"DGCC: A Case for Integration of Brain Cognition and Intelligence Computation","G.

China",2018 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW),"10 Feb 2019","2018","","","478","479","Both human brain and computer (electronic brain) could process data and do some cognition and computation tasks. Is the cognition of human brain equal to the computation of computer? It is obviously not. In this talk, the relationships of brain cognition models and intelligence computation models are summarized into four different types, that is, human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation (BCIIC), intelligence computation without human brain cognition (ICOBC), intelligence computation assisted human brain cognition (ICABC), and the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation (BC&IC). There are three paradigms in traditional artificial intelligence (AI) studies, that is, symbolism AI, connectionism AI, and behaviorism AI. The physical symbol system hypothesis is used in the symbolism AI. Human brain cognition is taken as a kind of symbolic processing, and the processes of human thinking are computed by symbol in the symbolism AI [1,2]. The connectionism AI relies on the bionics to simulate human brain. In the connectionism AI, neuron is taken as the basic unite of human thinking, and the intelligence is taken as the result of interconnected neurons competition and collaboration [3,4]. In the behaviorism AI, intelligence depends on the perception and behavior, “Perception-action” model is used, and intelligence may not require knowledge, knowledge representation and knowledge reasoning [5]. The symbolism AI and connectionism AI are two different types of human brain cognition inspired intelligence computation, while the behaviorism AI is a representative case of intelligence computation without human brain cognition. Usually, AI researchers get some inspiration from human brain cognition in their studies. On the other way, intelligence computation could also assist human brain cognition studies. The bidirectional cognitive computing model (BCC) is such a case. It studies the bidirectional transformations between the intension and extension of a concept. It is used to simulate some human brain cognition tasks such as learning and recognition [6,7]. Cognitive computing is one of the core fields of artificial intelligence [8,9]. Data-driven granular cognitive computing (DGCC) is an example of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation [10,11]. It takes data as a special kind of knowledge expressed in the lowest granularity level of a multiple granularity space. It integrates two contradictory mechanisms, namely, the human's cognition mechanism of ``global precedence'' which is a cognition process of ``from coarser to finer'' and the information processing mechanism of machine learning systems which is ``from finer to coarser'', in a multiple granularity space. It is data-driven cognitive computing model. The integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation would be an important research topic of artificial intelligence. Some scientific research issues of the integration of human brain cognition and intelligence computation are discussed based on DGCC.","2375-9259","978-1-5386-9288-2","10.1109/ICDMW.2018.00076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8637436","brain cognition, intelligence computation, artificial intelligence, cognitive computing, granular computing","Cognition;Cognitive systems;Computational modeling;Brain modeling;Rough sets;Conferences","","2","","11","IEEE","10 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, properly evaluating the effectiveness and, consequently, student progress in a course using games is still a challenge. One of the most widely implemented ways of evaluation is with an automated analysis of the code developed in the classes during the construction of digital games. Nevertheless, this topic has not yet been explored in aspects such as incremental learning, the model and teaching environment and the influences of acquiring skills and competencies of computational thinking. Motivated by this knowledge gap, this paper introduces a framework proposal to analyze the evolution of computational thinking skills in digital games classes. The framework is based on a data mining technique that aims to facilitate the discovery process of the patterns and behaviors that lead to the acquisition of computational thinking skills, by analyzing clusters with an unsupervised neural network of self-organizing maps (SOM) for this purpose. The framework is composed of a collection of processes and practices structured in data collection, data preprocessing, data analysis, and data visualization. A case study, using Scratch, was executed to validate this approach. The results point to the viability of the framework, highlighting the use of the visual exploratory data analysis, through the SOM maps, as an efficient tool to observe the acquisition of computational thinking skills by the student in an incremental course.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2924343","Pós-Graduação de Instituiçães de Ensino Particulares da Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES-PROSUP), Brazil; Corporación de Fomento de la Producción (CORFO) 14ENI2-26905 “Nueva Ingeniería para el 203”—Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Chile; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8743397","Analytical models;computer science education;data mining;data models;education;games;self-organizing feature maps","Games;Data mining;Education;Self-organizing feature maps;Conferences;Computer science","","20","","47","CCBY","21 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These require recursive task processing and meta-cognitive reasoning mechanism. Naturally, the human brain realizes these cognitive skills by prefrontal cortex which is a part of the neocortex. Previous studies about neurocognitive robotics would not meet these requirements. Thus, it is aimed at developing a brain-inspired robot control architecture that performs spatial-temporal and emotional reasoning. In this study, we present a novel solution that covers a computational model of the prefrontal cortex for humanoid robots. Computational mechanisms are mainly placed on the bio-physical plausible neural structures embodied in different dynamics. The main components of the system are composed of several computational modules including dorsolateral, ventrolateral, anterior, and medial prefrontal regions. Also, it is responsible for organizing the working memory. A reinforcement meta-learning based explainable artificial intelligence (xAI) procedure is applied to the working memory regions of the computational prefrontal cortex model. Experimental evaluation and verification tests are processed by the developed software framework embodied in the humanoid robot platform. The humanoid robots' perceptual states and cognitive processes including emotion, attention, and intention-based reasoning skills can be observed and controlled via the developed software.

In this context, we designed and implemented an online programming course for K-12 educators to provide qualification in CT and Programming basics, as well as to assess learners' attitudes towards Computing, how their motivation are expressed during the course, and the correlation between motivation and attitudes. The results indicate that participants' attitudes towards Computing has become more positive after the course, primarily their comprehension of CT and confidence to learn Computer Science. The outcomes also suggest a high level of learners' motivation over the course, and reveal a high correlation between the relevance expressed in the course with their interest and confidence towards Computing.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028492","Computational Thinking;K-12 Education;Teacher Education;Distance Learning","Computed tomography;Programming profession;Computer aided instruction;Tools","","4","","18","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We discuss our approach that combines a hands-on robotics platform with a block-based programming environment to facilitate the learning and application of cybersecurity and CT concepts. Throughout a week-long intervention, high school students were introduced to cybersecurity and CT and given the opportunity to apply this knowledge in a collaborative setting to solve security problems on the robotics platform with instructor and peer support. A series of competitions between groups of students further motivated students to translate their learned concepts to practice, often leading to breakthroughs as students incorporated new algorithms into their existing projects to counteract previous security flaws. We present evidence of the learning behaviors of several such groups through mixed-method case studies integrating data collected from learning performance, collaborative discourse, and analysis of program development.

Through a series of teacher survey and focus groups, this exploratory research presents the perspectives of K-12 teachers across three distinct vantage points: First, to what degree do these teachers see a clear value as to why CS and CT matter to their students' learning? Second (if the pathway is deemed valuable) who, in their estimates, are the crucial players to help develop a coherent CS/ CT K-12 pathway and what is their capacity? Third, how can such a prospective pathway be practically implemented? These elements of why, who, and how are essential to wider questions around equity of student access to high quality computing, and with this paper, they come from the perspectives of teachers-a group too often left out of early discussions around K-12 curricular design. Discussion section points to how these preliminary surveys and focus groups with teachers offer an early predictor in terms of how each district develops its own K-12 computing pathway, with the expectation that such focus groups offer a powerful research/ evaluation protocol that can be repeated annually among districts to gauge to what extent teachers' hope (and concerns) about comprehensive K-12 computing pathways are warranted.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272483","computational thinking;competency-based education;educational infrastructure","Education;Computer science;Standards;Stakeholders;Engineering profession;Encoding;Statistics","","","","15","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Few programmers encompass these skills, hampering software development and dampening the impact of UAS. We contend that early exposure to UAS software could help align workforce skills. However, early exposure requires curriculum that (1) captures the breadth of UAS software, (2) supports multiple levels of depth for diverse programming backgrounds and (3) fits within resource and institutional challenges. We propose a computational thinking framework. In our approach, lessons fit within 20-30 minute instructional blocks, making them usable in short workshop and extended classroom settings.

Background: Computer science (CS) courses are critical foundational courses for engineering students. CCEs that merge computational and creative thinking have been shown to increase achievement and learning of engineering and nonengineering students in CS1 courses, but previous research has used quasi- and non-experimental designs. Intended Outcomes: CCEs are intended to improve students' learning of CS1 content and problem-solving ability by fostering computational creativity. Application Design: CCEs can improve student learning and can be used to supplement other evidence-based instructional practices. Findings: Propensity score matching was used to create equivalent treatment and control groups; results show that students in the CCE implementation section had higher scores on a CS knowledge test than students in the control section, but not higher self-efficacy for their CS knowledge. Focus group and open-ended survey questions indicated that students had mixed reactions to the CCEs, with about half the students seeing them as improving their learning, understanding, and ability to apply CS in their engineering field. Responses also reinforced the importance of fully incorporating CCEs in courses and aligning them with course topics.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2018.2804350","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:0829647,1431874,1122956); UNL Phase II Pathways to Interdisciplinary Research Centers grant; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8303219","Achievement;computational creativity;computer science;CS1;evidence-based practice;self-efficacy","Creativity;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Engineering students;Tools;Teamwork;Computer science","","15","","29","IEEE","27 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article we present a methodology to model abstract representation of concepts without supervision, along with a mechanism to utilize generated models in an artificial system. Primarily, we illustrate a Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) approach that identifies abstract concepts, and dynamically builds a hierarchy to represent them. Further, we describe RANs learning, a novel way of associating concepts in two subsequent layers. We experimentally demonstrate how our approach is unsupervised, and able to model abstract activity (static-state and motion-state) of the subjects, using the Smart-phones Dataset from UCI machine learning repository for Human Activity Recognition problem.","2472-8489","978-1-5386-5346-3","10.1109/CONTROLO.2018.8514540","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8514540","Unsupervised Machine Learning;Artificial Systems;Context Modeling;Computational Cognitive Modeling","Computational modeling;Data models;Legged locomotion;Internet of Things;Activity recognition;Context modeling;Mathematical model","","4","2","19","EU","1 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is often arduous to analyze large amounts of recorded think-aloud sessions and few UX practitioners have an opportunity to get a second perspective during their analysis due to time and resource constraints. Inspired by the recent research that shows subtle verbalization and speech patterns tend to occur when users encounter usability problems, we take the first step to design and evaluate an intelligent visual analytics tool that leverages such patterns to identify usability problem encounters and present them to UX practitioners to assist their analysis. We first conducted and recorded think-aloud sessions, and then extracted textual and acoustic features from the recordings and trained machine learning (ML) models to detect problem encounters. Next, we iteratively designed and developed a visual analytics tool, VisTA, which enables dynamic investigation of think-aloud sessions with a timeline visualization of ML predictions and input features. We conducted a between-subjects laboratory study to compare three conditions, i.e., VisTA, VisTASimple (no visualization of the ML's input features), and Baseline (no ML information at all), with 30 UX professionals. The findings show that UX professionals identified more problem encounters when using VisTA than Baseline by leveraging the problem visualization as an overview, anticipations, and anchors as well as the feature visualization as a means to understand what ML considers and omits. Our findings also provide insights into how they treated ML, dealt with (dis)agreement with ML, and reviewed the videos (i.e., play, pause, and rewind).","1941-0506","","10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934797","NSERC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8807301","Think-aloud;visual analytics;machine intelligence;user study;usability problems;session review behavior;UX practices","Usability;Visual analytics;Tools;Machine intelligence;Feature extraction;Machine learning","","4","","45","IEEE","20 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While regional PD programs can provide in-person learning opportunities, geographic and time constraints often inhibit participation of teachers, particularly educators from less densely populated communities. This experience report shares findings from an online PD program modified from the existing in-person Exploring Computer Science (ECS) PD program to provide teachers a facilitated online learning community model to support their first year teaching the course. Using two years of data collected from pre-and post-PD surveys and course participation observations, this experience involved 152 teachers from 34 states and Washington, DC. The findings reveal how the development of a facilitated learning community model of professional development, heavily based on shared experience among participants, can increase CS teachers' confidence in adapting and delivering lessons that are designed to be engaging and accessible to all students. Findings also suggest that teachers highly valued the opportunity to authentically collaborate around their common computer science course with diverse instructors from all corners of the United States.

This paper shows how bringing data sources from the creative domain and from hedonic psychophysics together with machine learning and data analytics techniques can overcome this shortcoming to yield a system that can produce novel and high-quality creative artifacts. To demonstrate our data-driven approach, we developed and deployed a computational creativity system for culinary recipes and menus, Chef Watson, which can operate either autonomously or semiautonomously with human interaction.

Cognitive load theory states that learning outcomes can be positively affected by reducing the extraneous cognitive load associated with learning objectives as well as by changing the nature of what is learned. In the study reported upon here, a novel instructional method was developed to decrease students' cognitive load. Novel instructional content supported by a custom visualization tool was used in a classroom setting in order to help novice programmers develop an understanding of function-based problem decomposition within the context of a visual domain.

To do so, the study explores systems thinking and artificial neural networks to shed light on complexity in software-project behavior using nonlinear functional relationships between critical success factors and project success to utilize their connectedness as an approach in order to create project-outcome prediction models. The artificial neural networks were used to create two project-outcome prediction models: one for a binary classification task to discriminate failed from successful projects using a multi-input-single-output configuration and one for a multi-task binary classification to discriminate success from failure in multiple project-success dimensions using a multi-input multi-output configuration. The results yielded high-performance values for a binary classification task, performed to predict overall project success, and slightly lower performance values for the multi-task binary classification, which was also performed to predict success in project-success dimensions. It was found that the nonlinear behavior of critical success factors may be used to create prediction models, by embedding equifinality and connectedness constructs that prove to be useful to understand projects as complex, multi-loop, and nonlinear systems. Further research is needed to investigate the causality between critical success factors in order to explore the possible propagation of critical success factors within a project system network and its implications on project success.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3040169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9268157","Artificial neural networks;critical success factors;project success;prediction models;systems thinking","Software;Predictive models;Stakeholders;Project management;Artificial neural networks;Systems thinking;Complexity theory","","13","","106","CCBY","24 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In some cases, simple activities involving coding might be even included at kindergartens attended by children from three years of age. The crucial aim is to develop the so-called computational thinking which is going to be more and more essential for a successful personal and professional development of every individual. There is a broad range of factors influencing the success of the change in the curriculum, which is, inter alia, supposed to include coding. In addition to the necessary teaching aids and know-how, teachers also need to have positive attitudes towards its implementation. The main objective of our research is to identify teachers' attitudes towards introducing coding to their classes. We discovered that not all teachers of computing agree with including algorithmization and coding in their teaching. Approximately one half of the questioned educators hold a negative attitude towards the curricular change; they would rather continue teaching computer user skills and basic programs. Their attitude proves to be an impediment to a successful curricular change as teachers should fully grasp the teaching content and communicate it with enthusiasm to their pupils. Insufficient knowledge is the key factor influencing teachers' negative attitudes towards the introduction of coding to schools.","","978-1-7281-3180-1","10.1109/Informatics47936.2019.9119333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9119333","coding;school;teacher;computational thinking;pupil","","","3","","12","IEEE","17 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the different approaches to generate musical content, recent works have focused on general adversarial networks. One of these is the Midinet, which is considered the baseline model in this study. In this paper, we propose our Next Bar Predictor, a generative model that creates melody one bar at a time using the previous bar as basis to generate aesthetically pleasing melodies. We explore several variants of this by experimenting on different regression and classification models such as Decision Trees (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The models were trained using the dataset from Theorytab which consists of 460 songs. The outputs of these different variant models were then compared against those from the Midinet, using both machine-based objective scoring mechanism as well as human-based subjective evaluations. The dissimilarity scores obtained by our KNN (0.65) and DT (0.74) models, scored against the melodies in the dataset, are sufficiently high and indicates that both models are generally creative. Furthermore, based on the evaluation by human listeners, the melodies generated by our DT models are more realistic and pleasing than those of the Midinet. Casual listeners also prefer the DT model to be more interesting, although professional listeners think otherwise. Finally, all the variant models, when compared with Midinet, require much less training time and computational power. The proposed Next Bar Predictor is therefore a viable alternative for automated music generation.","","978-1-7281-4988-2","10.1109/ICCSP48568.2020.9182341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9182341","Computer generated music;machine learning;artificial intelligence","Bars;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Decision trees;Multilayer perceptrons;Training;Machine learning","","1","","20","IEEE","1 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is why it is a requisite course in most college curricula. Computational thinking is a broad term encompassing fundamental concepts of computing such as formulating problems and expressing their solutions in computational steps that can be processed by a computer. The ability to organize and analyze data is also a part of computational thinking. Following this paradigm, educational institutions have adopted various methods to teach computational thinking including programming. This paper will explore a specific project within the computational thinking course taught as an introductory course in all major programs at the Higher Colleges of Technology in the United Arab Emirates. The intention of the paper is to demonstrate how a project-based data analytics assessment in such a course can be used to foster in students, a greater awareness of a contemporary and critical global issue such as waste management. To examine the effectiveness of this project, the paper documents and evaluates the work of a group of students who carried out data analysis on secondary data collected from a notable website on “waste management”. The methodology implemented for this task is developed based on a prescribed course syllabus and assessment structure which promotes student-centered and inter-disciplinary learning.","","978-1-7281-4640-9","10.1109/ASET48392.2020.9118395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9118395","inter-disciplinary learning;cross-curricular;project-based learning;data analytics;coding;computer programming;global issues;waste management;computational thinking;engineering;digital;Python;academic;curriculum","Waste management;Data analysis;Collaborative work;Encoding;Task analysis;Programming profession;Creativity","","2","","17","IEEE","16 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Factorization memory and time, solution time, parallelization potential, and error will be considered in the comparisons between approaches. Drawing from advances in the area of integral equation (IE) methods that rely on relatively small but dense matrices, we will conjecture that direct solvers that minimize factorization fill-in while maintaining sparsity may not lead to the best overall strategy after all. We present an direct solution algorithm for FEM, based on domain decomposition that generates and operates on a lesser sparse matrix with block-wise sparse pattern, thus bridging the gap between the two extreme matrix structures, (a large fully sparse encountered in FEM and a smaller fully dense encountered in IE methods). Early results on 3D arbitrary tetrahedron meshes and arbitrary volumetric geometries suggest that the proposed approach significantly outperform state-of-the-art sparse matrix direct solvers in terms of memory while maintaining competitive run times for serial implementations.","","978-0-9960-0787-0","10.23919/ROPACES.2018.8364197","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8364197","Numerical Linear Algebra;Sparse Matrix Direct Methods;Finite Element Methods","Sparse matrices;Finite element analysis;Matrix decomposition;Iterative methods;Symmetric matrices;Electromagnetics;Computational modeling","","","","3","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We focus on the integrative performance of brain substructures, each of which is represented by a problem solver that is further modeled by a certain algorithm. Different levels of brain substructures, as well as the corresponding algorithms, are hierarchically organized both in structure and in function, including how and when higher-order solvers control lower-order ones. Different problem solvers share a same slice of working memory. This novelty is claimed since most of existing brain models emphasize on the neural network structure even though the neuron dynamics of brain is still very controversial. And we compare its performance to three other computational models in the face of a challenging foraging problem. Agents are examined in foraging environment with different sizes, and/or transparent barriers. The experimental results show that our model performed the best outright in most scenarios. Further, the results discover that the virtues of our primate brain lie not only in the heights of thinking it can reach, but also in its range and versatility.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3027355","Yiwu Industrial and Commercial College(grant numbers:ZD2020JD602-04); Key Project of Jinhua Science and Technology Bureau(grant numbers:2020-1-001); U.S. ONR(grant numbers:N00014-08-1-0693); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9207882","Cognitive hierarchical architecture;computational model;reinforcement learning;local and global planning","Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Problem-solving;Control systems;Learning (artificial intelligence);Cognition;Psychology","","2","","31","CCBY","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to increase female participation in this area, governments worldwide have been facilitating targeted interventions. One such initiative is the ‘Guyanese Girls Code’ (GGC) training program. This program was launched in 2018 with the aim of using Scratch and the BBC micro:bit to introduce girls at the Grade 7 to 9 levels to ICT education. In this paper, we propose a novel teaching model, the ‘Motivation, Support and Teaching Components’ tree model (MST-tree model). This model was critical to the design of GGC’s curriculum and teaching strategies. An evaluation was conducted to gather information on the program participants’ ICT perceptions and their experience of the training. The key findings revealed that the participants had a significant interest in learning about ICT even though they perceived the area to be difficult and local training opportunities to build their knowledge and skills were insufficient. Further, the girls portrayed high levels of self-efficacy, since they were interested in the program modules that they perceived to be most challenging. These findings suggest that the teaching model may address negative ICT perceptions when teaching females at the Grade 7 to 9 levels. As such, the MST-tree model has the potential to inform the design and execution of similar training programs and interventions.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9458209","BBC micro:bit;female secondary school students;ICT curriculum;MST-tree model;Scratch","Training;Scientific computing;Computational modeling;Government;Information and communication technology;Computational intelligence","","5","","39","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274063","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274063","modeling;UML;grammar instruction;computational thinking","Grammar;Unified modeling language;Education;Computational modeling;Informatics;Computer science;Tools","","2","","28","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To achieve the desired design, students use programming and computing concepts, such as loops, to solve those visual design centered problems, i.e. solving for composition, positive/negative space, balance, as opposed to computational problems first, i.e. create a loop, a fractal, randomized lines, etc. We present results from a study conducted on three high school summer courses. We compared the use of our Visual Design Problem-based teaching strategy (students wrote code to solve challenges based on art and design principles) to a traditional strategy (students wrote code to demonstrate comprehension of computer science concepts). Our results showed that test scores were higher for students in our Visual Design Problem-based courses. This work may have a positive impact on computer science education by increasing engagement, knowledge acquisition, and self-directed learning.","2642-5254","978-1-7281-1377-7","10.1109/VR.2019.8798013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8798013","Visual Design Problem-based Pedagogy;problem-based learning;Online Virtual Environments;Embodied Learning;Virtual Sculpting;Increase Programming Knowledge;Spatial Art;CCS [Human-centered Computing]: Human-computer interaction (HCI);Interaction paradigms-Virtual Reality;[Human-centered Computing]: CCS Human-computer interaction (HCI);Empirical studies in HCI","Art;Visualization;Virtual environments;Programming profession;Three-dimensional displays","","12","","23","IEEE","15 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Non-government organizations and local government units are faced with having to identify, assess, and monitor rapidly growing migrant communities in order to provide urgent humanitarian aid. However, with many of these displaced populations living in informal settlements areas across the country, locating migrant settlements over large territories can be a major challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach for rapidly and cost-effectively locating new and emerging informal settlements using machine learning and publicly accessible Sentinel-2 time series satellite imagery. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in identifying potential Venezuelan migrant settlements that have emerged between 2015 and 2020 in Colombia. Finally, we emphasize the importance of post-classification verification and present a two-step validation approach consisting of (1) remote validation using Google Earth and (2) on-the-ground validation through the Premise App, a mobile crowdsourcing platform.","","978-1-7281-7031-2","10.1109/AI4G50087.2020.9311041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9311041","poverty mapping;informal settlements;remote sensing;machine learning","Time series analysis;Satellites;Indexes;Earth;Vegetation mapping;Computational modeling;Sociology","","2","","20","IEEE","12 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The framework encounters difficulties on nonseparable problems, where variables interact with each other. Using the static grouping methods, variables will be theoretically grouped into one big subcomponent, whereas the random grouping strategy endures low efficiency. In this paper, a dynamic CC framework is proposed to tackle the challenge. The proposed framework works in a computationally efficient manner, in which the computational resources are allocated to a series of elitist subcomponents consisting of superior variables. First, a novel estimation method is proposed to evaluate the contribution of variables using the historical information of the best overall fitness. Based on the contribution and the interaction information, a dynamic grouping strategy is conducted to construct the dynamic subcomponent that evolves in the next evolutionary period. The constructed subcomponents are different from each other, and therefore the required parameters to control the optimization of each subcomponent vary a lot in each evolutionary period. A stage-by-stage parameter adaptation strategy is proposed to adapt the optimizer to the dynamic optimization environment.

The results reveal that wishful thinking weakens the effect of perceived avoidability on avoidance motivation. In turn, wishful thinking is positively affected by perceived threat and this effect is stronger when a user has low risk tolerance. Although perceived avoidability can reduce wishful thinking, its effect is fully mediated by perceived threat. This study highlights the important role of wishful thinking in affecting users' security behavior. It not only corroborates, but also extends the extant propositions of TTAT, thus making a significant contribution to IT security research and practice.","1558-0040","","10.1109/TEM.2018.2835461","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71471080); Neeley School of Business Research Excellence Award; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8667352","Emotion-focused coping;information technology (IT) security;problem-focused coping;technology threat avoidance theory (TTAT);threat;vignette study","Appraisal;Computer security;Psychology;Information technology;Computational modeling;Threat assessment","","19","","55","IEEE","14 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent's actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.","","978-1-7281-6929-3","10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185512","Opponent Modelling;Real-Time Strategy;Statistical Forward Planning;Evolutionary Algorithms;Monte Carlo Tree Search","Games;Computational modeling;Force;Planning;Adaptation models;Robustness;Predictive models","","4","","37","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2018.2873642","China NSFC(grant numbers:61802261); Shenzhen University(grant numbers:2018061); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 21203516); Research Grants Council of Hong Kong(grant numbers:CityU 11217817); Singapore MOE Tier 2(grant numbers:MOE2016-T2-2-023); NTU CoE(grant numbers:M4081879); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8481440","Traffic estimation;graph-parallel processing;non-linear correlation modeling","Roads;Estimation;Correlation;Computational modeling;Public transportation;Urban areas;Probes","","35","","52","IEEE","4 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2936919","IDiLyCo Project; Spanish Ministry of Economy, Industry and Competitiveness(grant numbers:TIN2015-66655-R); Project FEI INVITAR-IA of the University Complutense of Madrid; Andalusian Government under the University of Cadiz Programme for Researching and Innovation in Education 2015/2016(grant numbers:SOL-201500054211-TRA); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8811517","Narrative construction;draft revision;empirical observation;computational storytelling;cognitive models","Computational modeling;Task analysis;Writing;Planning;Receivers;Biological system modeling;Solid modeling","","","","32","CCBY","23 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.","","978-1-7281-2547-3","10.1109/SSCI47803.2020.9308494","Ministry of Human Resource Development; Jadavpur University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9308494","insight;creativity;EEG;spectrogram;capsule network","Electroencephalography;Creativity;Task analysis;Problem-solving;Feature extraction;Information filters;Convolution","","","","41","IEEE","5 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.","2156-8111","978-1-7281-3888-6","10.1109/ACII.2019.8925441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925441","Emotion;TDRL Emotion Theory;Computational Modelling;Regret","Computational modeling;Learning (artificial intelligence);Appraisal;Task analysis;Affective computing;Psychology;Robots","","5","","41","IEEE","9 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands. The effect was localized in parieto-occipital cortex, overlapping with the region showing synchronization during the tasks performance. Observed changes in resting-state EEG activity may be considered as an indicator of use-dependent neuroplasticity.","","978-1-7281-4401-6","10.1109/SIBIRCON48586.2019.8958329","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8958329","creative thinking;creative training;post-task changes;older adults;EEG","","","","","16","IEEE","16 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated.Our work sheds light on the kind of relationships and data models with which PLS-DA can be effective both as a feature selector as well as a classifier. In particular, we claim that when classes are determined by linear or non-linear relationships, PLS-DA provides almost no insight into the data. But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise. PLS-DA retains a strong performance even when the classes are contained in n-orthotopes (i.e., rectangular boxes in the subspace of the signal features).Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available.

But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined.

Due to privacy concerns, people may hesitate to share their locations and prohibit the growth of location-based services and analysis. The problem of protecting location privacy has been extensively studied in the literature. Sharing location data in sequence enable adversaries to apply privacy attacks by exploiting spatio-temporal constraints in road networks. In this paper, we identify a novel privacy attack that existing solutions cannot overcome for not considering upcoming sensitive locations in advance. We develop a technique to precompute the warning zone, i.e. the refined area where the disclosure of a user's actual location may enable adversaries to identify the user's sensitive locations in the future. Warning zones also enable users to reduce the frequency of not sharing locations for privacy reasons, and thereby improve the accuracy and utility of shared locations while guaranteeing the required level of location privacy of a user. Experiments using real datasets show that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art technique in terms of privacy, data utility and computational overhead.","1460-2067","","10.1093/comjnl/bxx130","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8853131","continuous location-based services and analysis;location privacy;warning zone","","","","","","","30 Sep 2019","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

As a first effort in tackling the issue, in this paper we propose a novel robot-mediated, collaborative problem solving activity for school children, called JUSThink, aiming at improving their computational thinking skills. JUSThink will serve as a baseline and reference for investigating how the robot's behaviour can influence the engagement of the children with the activity, as well as their collaboration and mutual understanding while working on it. To this end, this first iteration aims at investigating (i) participants' engagement with the activity (Intrinsic Motivation Inventory-IMI), their mutual understanding (IMIlike) and perception of the robot (Godspeed Questionnaire); (ii) participants' performance during the activity, using several performance and learning metrics. We carried out an extensive user-study in two international schools in Switzerland, in which around 100 children participated in pairs in one-hour long interactions with the activity. Surprisingly, we observe that while a teams' performance significantly affects how team members evaluate their competence, mutual understanding and task engagement, it does not affect their perception of the robot and its helpfulness, a fact which highlights the need for baseline studies and multi-dimensional evaluation metrics when assessing the impact of robots in educational activities.","1944-9437","978-1-7281-6075-7","10.1109/RO-MAN47096.2020.9223343","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9223343","educational robotics;collaborative problem solving;computational thinking;engagement;mutual modelling;robot perception;human-robot interaction","Conferences;Humanoid robots;Collaboration;Particle measurements;Collaborative work;Task analysis;Robots","","10","","27","IEEE","14 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The lower rate of student retention is often associated with considerable dropout and failure rates in introductory programming courses during the freshmen year. The main challenge is getting students to write meaningful programs in a short time by focusing more on computational thinking principles and less on language details at that point in time. Nowadays, most students prefer to be engaged and discover course content through exploration, interaction, and collaboration that is relevant, useful, and fun compared to traditional blackboard-based lecturing styles.

We operationalize this theory of analogical comparison in the context of biologically inspired design that uses biological analogies for conceptual design of technological systems. Our technique of analogical comparison supports evaluation of prior technological designs, biological source cases, as well as candidate conceptual designs through analogical mapping between alternative functional models of these design concepts. Given a functional model of a design concept and an alternative functional model of the same design concept, analogical comparison leverages a novel hierarchically organized analogical mapping technique to align the two models and identify the differences between them. Our technique is implemented in an operational artificial intelligence agent called Design Evaluation through Simulation and Comparison (DESC).

One such popular graph processing model-the vertex-centric computational model-does precisely this by distributing computations across the vertices of the graph being computed over. Due to this distribution of the program to the vertices of the graph, the programmer “thinks like a vertex” when writing their graph computation, with limited to no sense of shared memory and where almost all communication between each on-vertex computation must be sent over the network. Because of this inherent communication overhead in the computational model, reducing the number of messages sent while performing a given computation is a central aspect of any efforts to optimize vertex-centric programs. While previous work has focused on reducing communication overhead by directly changing communication patterns-by altering the way the graph is partitioned and distributed, or by altering the graph topology itself-in this paper we present a different optimization strategy based on a family of complementary compile-time program transformations in order to minimize communication overhead by changing both the messaging and computational structures of programs. Particularly, we present and formalize a method by which a compiler can automatically incrementalize a vertex-centric program through a series of compile-time program transformations-by modifying the on-vertex computation and messaging between vertices so that messages between vertices represent patches to be applied to the other vertex's local state. We empirically evaluate these transformations on a set of common vertex-centric algorithms and graphs and achieve an average reduction of 2.7X in total computational time, and 2.9X in the number of messages sent across all programs in the benchmark suite. Furthermore, since these are compile-time program transformations alone, other prior optimization strategies for vertex-centric programs can work with the resulting vertex-centric program just as they would a non-incrementalized program.","1530-2075","978-1-7281-1246-6","10.1109/IPDPS.2019.00109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8821014","Compilers;Vertex-Centric Computation;Incrementalization","Computational modeling;Optimization;Informatics;Writing;Benchmark testing;Programming;Distributed processing","","5","","20","IEEE","2 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

COPOD first constructs an empirical copula, and then uses it to predict tail probabilities of each given data point to determine its level of ""extremeness"". Intuitively, we think of this as calculating an anomalous p-value. This makes COPOD both parameter-free, highly interpretable, and computationally efficient. In this work, we make three key contributions, 1) propose a novel, parameter-free outlier detection algorithm with both great performance and interpretability, 2) perform extensive experiments on 30 benchmark datasets to show that COPOD outperforms in most cases and is also one of the fastest algorithms, and 3) release an easy-to-use Python implementation for reproducibility.","2374-8486","978-1-7281-8316-9","10.1109/ICDM50108.2020.00135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9338429","outlier detection;anomaly detection;copula;data mining","Conferences;Computational modeling;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Computational efficiency;Task analysis;Anomaly detection","","166","","14","IEEE","9 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we analyze the prediction performance of ANFIS models using different input space partitioning methods. ANFIS 1 uses SC (Subtractive Clustering), a clustering method based on the density of data, to calculate the center of the cluster by calculating potential values inversely proportional to the distances of the different inputs. ANFIS 2 uses Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering, which is a clustering method based on degree of belonging to data, and classifies each data belonging to each cluster according to degree of affiliation. ANFIS 3 is a method of using Context based Fuzzy C-Means (CFCM) clustering, which is a clustering method considering characteristics of input and output space based on FCM clustering. It creates clusters for each context generated according to characteristics of output space, to classify the data. To evaluate these ANFIS models, we use short term electricity price forecasting data and Boston housing data. The prediction performance is based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) method. Experimental results show that the prediction performance of the ANFIS model is different depending on the characteristics of each data.

Studies are still searching for methods, tools, and instruments to evaluate CT skills to allow effective adoption. Problem-solving is critical to mathematics, and introducing robotics in this context can favor the learning process. The goal of this study is to apply educational robotics in a Brazilian public high school and evaluate the impact on the development of CT skills and mathematical performance. Two research questions guide the study: (RQ1) Can the use of robotics favor the development of CT skills? (RQ2) Can the use of robotics favor math learning? The development of CT skills was evaluated through the Bebras Challenge, and the annual performance obtained by the students in mathematics was considered to evaluate the impact on mathematics. The overall results pointed out that the use of robotics can favor the learning of mathematics and they bring some indications that the use of robot kits can stimulate the development of CT skills, but still more research is needed.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028384","","Robots;Mathematics;Erbium;Education;Problem-solving;Programming","","4","","34","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such uncertainty has been often modeled based on the linguistic information by using single linguistic terms. Dealing with linguistic information in DM demands processes of computing with words whose main characteristic is to emulate human beings reasoning processes to obtain linguistic outputs from linguistic inputs. However, often single linguistic terms are limited or do not express properly the expert's knowledge, being necessary to elaborate richer linguistic expressions easy to understand and able to express greater amount of knowledge, as it is the case of the comparative linguistic expressions based on hesitant fuzzy linguistic terms sets. Nevertheless, current computational models for comparative linguistic expressions present limitations both from understandability and precision points of view. The 2-tuple linguistic representation model stands out in these aspects because of its accuracy and interpretability dealing with linguistic terms, both related to the use of the symbolic translation, although 2-tuple linguistic values are still limited by the use of single linguistic terms. Therefore, the aim of this article is to present a new fuzzy linguistic representation model for comparative linguistic expressions that takes advantage of the goodness of the 2-tuple linguistic representation model and improve the interpretability and accuracy of the results in computing with words processes, resulting the so-called extended comparative linguistic expressions with symbolic translation. Taking into account the proposed model, a new computing with words approach is presented and then applied to a DM case study to show its performance and advantages in a real case by comparing with other linguistic decision approaches.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2019.2940424","Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness; Spanish National Research(grant numbers:TIN2015-66524-P,PGC2018-099402-B-I00); Postdoctoral Fellowship Ramón y Cajal(grant numbers:RYC-2017-21978); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8827628","Computing with words;comparative linguistic expressions;decision making (DM);hesitant fuzzy linguistic term set;symbolic translation","Linguistics;Computational modeling;Proposals;Decision making;Uncertainty;Semantics;Cognition","","58","","84","IEEE","9 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, cognitive skills are not sufficient for a successful life. Understanding and managing the emotions of oneself is another crucial factor in success. The current state of the art teaching methods educates the kids about programming and emotional intelligence independently. In our opinion, it is advantageous to teach kids emotional intelligence, along with the programming concepts. However, the literature lacks the studies that make students emotionally aware while teaching them programming. This research aims to prepare students to be cognitively healthy as well as emotionally intelligent with the hypothesis that a kid's emotional intelligence can be enhanced while teaching them cognitive skills. We proposed a computational model that teaches programming and emotional intelligence side by side to students. The model provides a curriculum and related tools. For evaluations, five hundred students of a public school were involved in different activities to find the effectiveness of the proposed model. These students were divided into five groups (A, B, C, D, and E), each having a mean age of 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years, respectively. Students performed multiple adaptive scenarios of path-finding that were based on self-awareness, social-awareness, sharing, and empathy emotions. Students provide the programming instructions such as sequencing, conditional statements, and looping to a robot.

National personalities and elongated election seasons inundated with negative campaigning may have ""turned-off"" potential voters, but as the popular aphorism goes, ""all politics are local,"" and thus local conditions should be interrogated to help understand voting and other forms of political participation. To this end, this study seeks to probe more deeply into this phenomenon by examining local political participation in the American states. For reasons we outline below, we specifically focus on local political participation in the state of Tennessee (TN) Utilizing data from the 2016 Congressional Cooperative Election Study (CCE), we ask what local-level factors most likely influence political participation among Blacks in TN? In order to parse through the large 2016 CCES dataset more efficiently, we employ software programming tools to address our primary questions using computational thinking and research methods. This technology-driven style of political thinking demonstrates the utility of adopting computing tools and data-driven approaches to identify and address areas of concern across government and civic society. One implication of this work is that it highlights the need for political actors to think more locally when crafting strategies for outreach and engagement towards historically disadvantaged race groups.","","978-1-7281-7624-6","10.1109/CSCI51800.2020.00114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457993","Political Theory;Election;Machine Learning;African Americans","Electric potential;Scientific computing;Voting;Tools;Programming;Software;Computational efficiency","","","","41","IEEE","23 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The possibility of a clear formulation of the principle, which is naturally called the Pavlov Principle (PP), arose only recently, as a result of the victorious procession of the family of computer training algorithms such as Deep Learning, which led to extremely efficient schemes for using ""fine-grained"" computing devices (GPU, etc.) solving cognitively complex problems.

Despite the success in most of the activities, classroom interactions and assessments of students' work emerged as areas that deserve more attention. The objective of this study is to develop a pilot project aimed at maintaining acceptable and secured levels of interactions and assessments. The setting for this study includes virtual classroom interactions, peer level tutoring sessions, and formative assessments. To improve the interactions, efficacious assessment methods deploying incremental levels of thinking were used. This requires a third-party program for embedding questions on prerecorded lectures. The questions were then randomized and assigned to the subjects. The use of hierarchical randomization of multiple-choice questions for the short quizzes resulted in reduction of cheating. The performance of the students in the four sections of a calculus course used for this project improved by 17%.

"A Nifty Inter-Class Peer Learning Model for Enhancing Student-Centered Computing Education, and for Generating Student Interests in Co-Curricular Professional Development","A. Chattopadhyay; B. Chindaphone","Department of Information and Computing Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, United States; Department of Information and Computing Sciences, University of Wisconsin - Green Bay, Green Bay, WI, United States",2018 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"7 Mar 2019","2018","","","1","5","This Work-In-Progress paper in the Innovative Practice Category presents an innovative model of inter-class peer collaboration that enhances student learning in computing education, and addresses student conceptual gaps. It expands the scope of traditional peer learning beyond the usual classroom setting and motivates student creativity leading to interests in co-curricular professional development. This nifty peer learning model connects computing students from an upper level class with students of a lower level class, so that they can aid each other in a mentor-mentee relationship to address conceptual learning gaps. Existing literature on computing educational research show that several peer learning models have been used in a typical classroom setting for reinforcing learning. However, very few peer learning models have been used in an inter-class setting, and none have been driven by student conceptual gaps in order to create an enhanced learning environment. Our model focuses on developing student interests in further co-curricular professional development opportunities in the form of peer mentoring, tutoring and instruction. Currently, student retention is a significant challenge for computing educators, given the demand of the computing disciplines for an all-round solid knowledge base, including grasping of complex technical concepts. Our approach of inter-class peer collaboration strengthens the learning environment of both lower level and upper level computing courses, and provides much needed support to students, whose knowledge base is still underdeveloped and conceptual understanding is undercooked. This unique form of inter-class peer learning provides upper level students with an exclusive opportunity to reinforce their conceptual grasps by mentoring lower level students. It also enables the lower level students to receive peer guidance for addressing their conceptual gaps. Our improvised peer networking model adds a different dimension to the practice of intra-class peer learning and extends peer learning beyond the traditional bounds. It promotes a new kind of service learning project in classes by encouraging peer mentoring that leads to peer connections across classes. It aids student retention by helping lower level student mentees get over their knowledge limitations. Our work-in-progress research case study indicates that this model inspires peer mentors to engage in out-of-box thinking by challenging them to find creative ways for overcoming conceptual shortcomings of mentees. This, in turn, generates student interests in enhanced co-curricular professional development. Additionally, our ongoing experimental study results show that this model can help in producing a sustainable pool of peer mentors, tutors and teaching assistants, who can become resources plus role-models for other students, and for helping student retention. As part of our in-progress experiments, this model has been deployed within our computer programming classes, where CS2 students have been paired with CS1 students based upon conceptual gaps and knowledge shortcomings. As we conduct these teaching experiments, we analyze the performance of our model through data obtained by conducting student surveys. We discuss these initial collected data and cite them as preliminary evidence in the process of evaluating our model in terms of the improved learning, and generated student interests plus engagement in professional development.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658454","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658454","nifty;inter-class;peer learning;co-curricular professional development;student-centered;computing education;interests;engagement;conceptual gaps","Computational modeling;Mentoring;Programming profession;Collaboration;Data models","","1","","10","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Stealth assessment analyzes a stream of fine-grained student interaction data from a game-based learning environment to dynamically draw inferences about students' competencies through evidence-centered design. In evidence-centered design, evidence models have been traditionally designed using statistical rules authored by domain experts that are encoded using Bayesian networks. This article presents DeepStealth, a deep learning-based stealth assessment framework, that yields significant reductions in the feature engineering labor that has previously been required to create stealth assessments. DeepStealth utilizes end-to-end trainable deep neural network-based evidence models. Using this framework, evidence models are devised using a set of predictive features captured from raw, low-level interaction data to infer evidence for competencies. We investigate two deep learning-based evidence models, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) and n-gram encoded feedforward neural networks (FFNNs). We compare these models' predictive performance for inferring students' knowledge to linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) and naïve Bayes models. We perform feature set-level analyses of game trace logs and external pre-learning measures, and we examine the models' early prediction capacity. The framework is evaluated using data collected from 182 middle school students interacting with a game-based learning environment for middle grade computational thinking. Results indicate that LSTM-based stealth assessors outperform competitive baseline approaches with respect to predictive accuracy and early prediction capacity. We find that LSTMs, FFNNs, and CRFs all benefit from combined feature sets derived from both game trace logs and external pre-learning measures.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2019.2922356","National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CNS-1138497,DRL-1640141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735739","Computational thinking;deep learning;educational games;game-based learning;stealth assessment.","Hidden Markov models;Computational modeling;Games;Predictive models;Task analysis;Adaptation models;Computer science","","39","","80","IEEE","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The author tries to apply the reinforcement learning method to the design process of Game of the Amazons evaluation function. Using the self-game generated data sets and reward signals to stimulates network, it could learn how to evaluate the situation of chess board without human experience. Then this neural network can be used as an evaluation function. Finally, through battling with the game of Amazon chess game using traditional evaluation function, it is verified that the evaluation function design method proposed in this paper can reduce the human experience requirement in the design process of Game of the Amazons evaluation function and effectively evaluate the situation.","1948-9447","978-1-7281-0106-4","10.1109/CCDC.2019.8832463","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8832463","Reinforcement Learning;Neural Networks;Amazon Chess Game;Evaluation Functions","Games;Biological neural networks;Training;Reinforcement learning;Design methodology","","1","","4","IEEE","12 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a decentralization method in order to improve the computational performance of hybrid state estimators with minimum loss of accuracy. The proposed method utilizes sensitivity matrix that relates measurement errors to state estimates in order to form the so-called isolated bus groups and observable subislands. Although the proposed decentralization method can be applied to any state estimator, the paper is developed using a least absolute value (LAV) estimator for demonstration purposes, which is known to be robust against bad data. The high computational burden of LAV estimator compared to the well-known weighted least squares estimator is eliminated, thanks to the proposed decentralization method.","1558-0679","","10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2720626","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959612","Synchronized measurements;phasor measurement units;hybrid state estimation;decentralization;critical measurements","Phasor measurement units;Power measurement;Voltage measurement;State estimation;Current measurement;Robustness;Power systems","","14","","23","IEEE","27 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Under the purpose of minimizing the amount of modification, an optimization model is constructed to achieve an acceptable worst consistency level for a HFLPR. A linear programming model is established to reduce the difficulty of solving the presented optimization model. It ensures the consistency indices related to all the possible linguistic preference relations (LPRs) from a given HFLPR meet the predefined consistency level requirement.

Segmentation of visual scenes was confined to the extraction of object boundaries present in the image data. However, with the progressive developments in technology, machines are expected to produce assistive decisions to aid versatile tasks. Subsequently, these assistive decisions are dependent on efficient results and must project information on a granular level from the visual scenes. The visual scenes are usually of vast variety depending on the scenarios in which the image data is captured. As per recent trends, semantic segmentation is still an open area of research, one of its worth mentioning challenges is to handle the visually adverse images. These visually adverse images are the result of low light/ high light, rain, fog and sometimes in the form of too many objects present in the scene. The study sheds light on the non-trivial problem and diverts attention to the gaps present in literature by providing in-depth critical analysis. This study comprehensively presents unidentified problems prevailing in existing semantic segmentation techniques. A critical literary study is conducted to examine the working mechanics of existing solutions to identify their limitations to produce accurate results for the visually adverse scenarios. The study discusses some of the possible reasons which result in erroneous semantic segmentation results for visually adverse images.

However, the integration of computing remains obstructed by resources and lack of professional development to support students' learning. Further challenging is students' STEM attitudes and interest do not matriculate with them into higher education. This issue is especially critical for traditionally under represented and underserved populations including females, racial/ethnic minority groups, and students of low-socioeconomic status (SES). To help mitigate challenges, we developed an unplugged (computer-less) computing engineering and robotics lesson composed of two introductory computing concepts, sequencing and decision-making, using a small robot arm and tangible programming blocks. Through students' sequencing of operations, debugging, and executing complex robotic behavior, we seek to determine if students' interest or attitudes change toward engineering. Nine one-hour introductory pilot lessons with 148 students, grades 6-10, at two public middle schools, and one summer camp were conducted. We measured students' engineering interest and attitudes through a 15 question pre- and post-lesson survey and calculated aggregate factor scores for interest and attitudes. We found low-SES students' a priori interests and attitudes tend to be lower and more varied than those of their high-SES peers. These preliminary results suggest that the integration of introductory computing and robotics lessons in low-SES classrooms may help students reach similar levels of engineering interest and attitudes as their high-SES peers.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658959","robotics;computational thinking;K-12","Robot sensing systems;Debugging;Programming profession;Education","","13","","27","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this has been changing thanks to the widespread idea that all children should have the opportunity to learn a little computer skills from an early age, since they will live in a world where computing is everywhere. Aware that the teaching of programming is not the future but the present, countries such as the United States, Singapore, Estonia and even Spain, face this strategic challenge, which not only prepares students for an increasingly technological labour market, it encourages the development of useful skills for any student regardless of their future professional activity. With this idea in mind, this article describes the case study carried out in a classroom of Early Childhood Education, with students of 5 years of age, with which basic programming concepts have been worked out.

The teaching methodology of the algorithm disciplines of the first years of Computer Engineering courses directly affects student performance throughout the course. The current education system is in transition, taking slow steps in new ways of learning. By promoting self-reflection and critical thinking, students can develop problem-solving skills and observe an application of the tools learned. A proposed methodology includes new structuring of the discipline ""Algorithms and Data Structures I"" at the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande (FURG), with the learning of a modern programming language and the transformation of the classic classroom model to new methods and dynamics. Computational thinking is fundamental at the beginning of the course. From this, all students receive a introduction course at the beginning of the college year to immerse in dynamics to practice logic. Classes began, students received an extension to the basic learning of the discipline (the fundamentals of algorithms and Python as a modern programming language) and at the same time they received an assignment, a problem resolution, where they had space and time to develop a game with the theme of their choice. The activity requires teamwork and creativity. As lectures run as workshops, allowing collaboration and project creation, with the help of teachers and older students as tutors. To complete the program, an event made available by the university was used as an environment, for visitors, scholars as well for high school juniors interested in software, to attend and learn about. As a preliminary result of the new implementation methodology, after 4 years, there was an increase in the approval and average grade of learners.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274109","education;algorithms;computing;teaching methodology","Games;Programming;Programming profession;Conferences;Training;Tools;Problem-solving","","","","25","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Interest in music as information becomes especially noticeable with the development of artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence algorithms are used to determine musical preferences, provide personal recommendations on streaming services, and compose music. Artificial intelligence is predicted to have a strong impact on the music content creation process. Modern music software tools are showing impressive results. However, musical systems based on artificial intelligence lack human intelligence, i.e., the ability to understand the meaning of musical works. Focus on software and insufficient attention to human intelligence indicate that the problem of creating musical artificial intelligence remains extremely underestimated and is one of the urgent problems of modern information technologies. Objective of the research: theoretical substantiation and development of a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. Methods: information and semantic method for the study of cultural exchanges in the musical environment by A.B. Kayak; theoretical analysis of the probabilistic approach to the problem of meaning by V.V. Nalimov; method of probabilistic evaluation of meanings by S.G. Fadushin. Results: the analytical framework is provided for a convergent approach to the creation of musical systems based on artificial intelligence. The obtained results will allow to create information and control systems based on artificial intelligence in the musical environment. The information provided in the article may be of theoretical and practical interest for researchers and developers of artificial intelligence in the field of the music industry. The results may also be used by teachers, students, graduate students, researchers studying the philosophy and sociology of musical culture.","","978-1-7281-6951-4","10.1109/FarEastCon50210.2020.9271097","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9271097","meaning;music;artificial intelligence;machine intelligence;convergent approach","Music;Artificial intelligence;Semantics;Probabilistic logic;Industries;Human intelligence;Information technology","","4","","15","IEEE","8 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our application includes two distinct modes that invite casual creators to engage with deep convolutional neural networks to co-create custom artworks. The first mode, `magic markers', mimics painting with a brush on a canvas, enabling users to paint a style onto selected areas of an image. The second mode, `compositing stamps', uses a real-time method for applying style filters to selected portions of an image. Specifically, we focus on style transfer networks created from canonical and contemporary works of data visualization and data art in order to investigate the versatility and flexibility of the algorithm. In addition to enabling a novel creative workflow, the process of interactively modifying an image via multiple style transfer networks reveals meaningful features encoded within the networks, and provides insight into the effects particular networks have on different images, or different regions within a single image. To evaluate Data Brushes, we gathered expert feedback from participants of a data science symposium and ran an observational study, finding that our application facilitates the creative exploration of neural style transfer for data art and enhances user intuition regarding the expressive range of style transfer features.","","978-1-7281-5027-7","10.1109/VISAP.2019.8900858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8900858","Style transfer;data art;casual creators;creative AI","","","1","","41","IEEE","14 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work proposes the use of statistical Language Models, as well as the perplexity metric, for the generation of culinary recipes. In this work, we also developed a system for automatic generation of creative culinary recipes using two approaches: one based on a genetic programming algorithm guided by the proposed language model; and the other based on a decomposition of existing recipes and recomposition of new recipes through a genetic algorithm guided by the proposed language model. This second approach achieved the best results. For this approach, a total of 6 recipes were generated to evaluate, through an online survey, the influence of the Language Model in the generation of recipes with better use of secondary ingredients, oils and seasonings, throughout the preparation steps. In the comparison between these two groups of recipes, the respondents considered the recipes generated using the language model as having the best quality, presenting an average evaluation of 63.6% of the scale (i.e. between medium and good use of oils and seasonings compared to recipes from the other group). In addition, a recipe from this approach was cooked and tasted for taste assessment, obtaining an average evaluation of 93% of the scale.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3013436","Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - Brasil (CAPES)(grant numbers:001); Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq); Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de Minas Gerais (FAPEMIG); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153554","Language models;culinary recipe;computational creativity","Creativity;Brain modeling;Probability;Measurement;Computational modeling;Context modeling;Artificial intelligence","","5","","24","CCBY","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Scientists share, discuss and critically argue over different representations of a problem with others when attempting to generate new knowledge. Similarly, collaboration can be beneficial for inquiry-based science learning at school. Successful collaborative learning, however, relies on engaging students in a condition of positive interdependence. In this paper we propose that asymmetric simulations provide an innovative way to establish positive interdependence among students during inquiry learning which will foster the development of their collaboration skills. Asymmetric simulations divide some information or resources necessary to solve a problem unevenly among group members, thereby requiring more equal participation and contribution among all members during collaboration. The asymmetric simulations we developed are available online for free via the Go-Lab portal (golabz.eu) and therefore can be easily integrated into a digital lesson by school teachers. They were created taking into account the small screen sizes of smart devices such as smartphones or tablets, thereby making them convenient for collaborative work in school classrooms.","2161-377X","978-1-7281-6090-0","10.1109/ICALT49669.2020.00045","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9155960","asymmetric collaboration;interdependence;computer simulations;inquiry-based science;smart devices","Collaboration;Task analysis;Computer simulation;Education;Computational modeling;Collaborative work;Smart devices","","3","","7","IEEE","4 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Common applications of document Clustering includes grouping similar news articles, analysis of customer feedback, text mining, duplicate content detection, finding similar documents, search optimization and many more. This lead to utilization of these documents for finding required information in a competent and efficient manner. Document clustering required a measurement for evaluating how surprising two given information are.

These four phenomena are closely related to the light-based properties of presence, knowledge, power, and harmony, central to a multilayered light-based model of reality that also offers alternative foundation for thinking about quanta and quantum computation. In this model, it is not a random process from infinite superposed possibilities that exist at the quantum-level as supposed by the Copenhagen Interpretation, and as assumed as the foundation of the infinite processing capability of quantum objects by contemporary pioneers of quantum computing. Rather, the infinite processing capability is due to a more ordered display of superposition, entanglement, tunneling and annealing: superposition, as an ordered concord of light's property of presence stacked in logical arrangement by layer of light; entanglement, as a display of light's property of knowledge that occurs at a speed faster than the known speed of light; tunneling, as a display of light's property of power that allows toggling between different “realities” in layers of light; and annealing, expressing light's property of harmony, to find an ideal minimum state among a number of realities. These four quantum phenomena derivative from an implicit and natural unity within light, engineered to maintain that unity externally, will confer quantum computation with the possibility of extraordinary processing power.","2644-3163","978-1-7281-8416-6","10.1109/IEMCON51383.2020.9284871","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9284871","Quantum Computation;Symmetries in Light;Superposition;Entanglement;Quantum Tunneling;Quantum Annealing;Computational Power","Quantum computing;Annealing;Quantum entanglement;Computational modeling;Tunneling;Mobile communication;Random processes","","3","","17","IEEE","22 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Though membership functions are determined through expert's opinion, however, the one estimated through heuristic algorithms is the preferable methods. Membership functions determined through statistical and knowledge engineering methods are usually application dependent and cannot be applied on different datasets. This research focuses on generating the parametric values of the triangular membership function using a novel method. Initially, the Fuzzy C-means algorithm is utilized to generate the parameters values of the Gaussian membership function. Using a set of equations, these values then estimate the parameters of the triangular membership function. The proposed method is applied to the quality of web services data.

For this reason, a number of researchers have paid their attention to develop the reasonable analysis method for vessel-bridge collisions in the past twenty or thirty years, facilitating the development of the design methodology of bridge structures under vessel collisions. For example, with the development of the nonlinear contact-impact finite element (FE) technique, the FE-based method has been developed and used in engineering practices. Also, some simplified methods have been proposed based on the nonlinear contact-impact FE technique. Although these methods are capable of clarifying the interaction mechanism between vessels and bridges, they cannot be used to replace the code-prescribed static analysis method due to computational efficiency. Hence, this paper places emphasis on the code-prescribed static analysis method. First, the limitation of the code-prescribed static analysis method is presented by comparing their results with the dynamic results. Then, based on the two degrees of freedom (DOF) system, the equivalent static analysis method considering the load pattern is investigated through the shock spectrum analysis method. This work provides an idea for improving the code-specified static analysis method.","","978-1-7281-1366-1","10.1109/ICSCSE.2018.00018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8705444","","","","","","15","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These two problems are difficult, but deep learning models can tackle them. We think that this paper is the first work to approach Rule Extraction with deep learning.

In this paper, we present a novel intuitionistic fuzzy logic based conversational recommender that can provide guidance to users when using science gateways for research and education workflows. The users interact with a context-aware chatbot that is embedded within custom web-portals to obtain simulation tools/resources to accomplish their goals. In order to ensure user goals are met, the chatbot profiles a user's cyberinfrastructure and neuroscience domain proficiency level using a `usability quadrant' approach.

Each task can be executed in a container within a virtual machine (VM), where the container packaging the function for the task should be loaded into the VM before task execution. To reduce the workflow execution time and the network bandwidth consumption, we propose a cost-efficient and latency-aware workflow scheduling algorithm that strategically loads the containers into VMs and executes the tasks on the VMs. The algorithm is based on “Stretch Out and Compact”, which can stretch out the tasks along the resources by critical path analysis and then find the inefficient slots within the computing resources and eventually compact the tasks into those slots. We introduce a concept of “virtual task” into the algorithm, where container loading is regarded as a virtual task that should be executed before the real task. The introduction of the virtual task can be more effective in finding the inefficient slots for the compaction, thus resulting in a more efficient workflow scheduling policy. Simulation results show that compared to the algorithms that fully or selectively load the dockers, the proposed algorithm can achieve less execution time while saving network bandwidth consumption for loading dockers.","1521-9097","978-1-5386-7308-9","10.1109/PADSW.2018.8644945","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8644945","Workflow scheduling;resource efficiency;container-based systems","Task analysis;Containers;Loading;Scheduling algorithms;Scheduling;Computational modeling","","1","","20","IEEE","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The proposed model is a three-layer fusion of data, information and knowledge with human intelligence, which exploits ontological knowledge modeling, rule-based reasoning and a human-computer interaction mechanism. The interaction and collaboration within the model depend on a pair of complementary schemes in a loop: the top-down scheme from the knowledge layer to the data layer that is used to search for stable cognitive patterns; and the bottom-up scheme from the data layer to the knowledge layer that is used to deeply analyze cognitive functions. As a key factor, human beings participate in the whole learning process of the model, which in turn assists human beings to make decisions. To verify the applicability of the present model in cognitive research, a series of fMRI experiments and analytic methods (e.g. statistical tests and network topology analysis) were conducted.

Influence maximization problem plays a vital role in commercial marketing, news propagation, rumor control and public services. However, the existing algorithms for influence maximization usually tend to select one aspect from efficiency and accuracy as its main improving objective. This method of excessively pursuing one metric often leads to performing poorly in other metrics. Hence, we think that algorithms for influence maximization should make a suitable compromise between computation efficiency and result accuracy instead of excessively pursuing for one metric. Based on the above understanding, this paper proposes a new algorithm, called Global Selection Based on Local Influence (LGIM). The basic idea of the proposed algorithm is following: if a node can influence another node with large influence, the node also has large influence. Therefore, a two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes is proposed, which can reduce a large number of running time. Moreover, this paper also proposes a new objective function to estimate the influence spread of a node set. In summarize, the proposed algorithm utilizes the two-stage filtering strategy of candidate nodes to avoid unnecessary computation, and adopts a new objective function to replace time-consuming Monte-Carle simulations. Experimental results on six real-world social networks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms other four comparison algorithms when comprehensively considering computation efficiency and result accuracy.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963100","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976126); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945390","Social networks;influence maximization;local influence;global selection","Social networking (online);Integrated circuit modeling;Heuristic algorithms;Greedy algorithms;Computational modeling;Technological innovation;Linear programming","","13","","28","CCBY","30 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the effectiveness of feedback on students' learning activities, when students learn engineering processes based on computer based simulations, is much less well known. The purpose of this study is to analyze the impact of “correcting feedback” (i.e. the feedback indicates only students' mistakes) and “reflective feedback” (i.e. the feedback includes a hint to encourage the student to re-think a specific answer) on learning effectiveness of engineering students, when using computer based simulation in order to enhance the learning of engineering processes. The impact of “reflective feedback” is analyzed by carrying out semi-quasi experiments using experimental and control groups of students. It is found that “reflective feedback” does not result in higher learning effectiveness and that the students of this study prefer to correct their mistakes by focusing on “correcting feedback” and previously learned content, while using a “trial and error mentality”. The results provide evidence, first, about the impact of students' learning background when using teaching simulators, and, secondly, that simulators showing both, “correcting feedback” and “reflective feedback”, may reduce the stimulating effect of “reflective feedback” because of the presence of “correcting feedback”. Consideration of these findings will contribute to further improvement of process teaching simulators.

External evaluation of this project has been an integral part of the project from the beginning and, along with the project team’s observations and input, has significantly reshaped the project activities. It became clear after the first year that a central challenge of this project would be working with a mix of teachers across multiple domains – from teachers who had little experience even using computers to teachers who had computer science degrees; from teachers who came to teaching from professional backgrounds to those who had education degrees; and from beginning teachers to those who had been teaching the same courses for twenty years. Through evaluation data and really listening to teacher feedback, we not only tailored the PD content and structure, but also refined the data collection instruments and evaluation design to bridge the gap between different teacher experiences and levels of preparation. As a result, we have been able to bring computing into non-technical content areas such as Hospitality and non-programming classes such as Photography, as well as support computing educations in New Hampshire CTE programs. In Year 4, we now better understand the range of benefits and challenges involved in working with CTE programs and inserting CCC-inspired curricular modules in non-computing courses.","","978-1-5386-1363-4","10.1109/RESPECT.2018.8491714","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8491714","teacher professional learning;career and technocal edcuation;inquiry and equity-based teaching professional development evaluation","Education;Handheld computers;Engineering profession;Programming profession;Photography;Interviews;Instruments","","","","","IEEE","14 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, the brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development (e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces. Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional approach and evidence-based a priori knowledge about specific signal features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view. Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory. Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even on having less number of training samples.","","978-1-5386-5301-2","10.1109/ICCPS.2018.00034","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8443741","brain interfaces;spatiotemporal;fractional dynamics;unknown inputs;classification;motor prediction","Brain modeling;Brain-computer interfaces;Electroencephalography;Complex networks;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Spatiotemporal phenomena","","25","","40","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study examines work by researchers and practitioners in Mississippi to engage all public school students and the workforce with computational thinking, computer science concepts, and cybersecurity, providing pathways for learning that make computing education accessible for all citizens. The state of Mississippi has the lowest median wage in the nation, and one of the lowest rates of STEM employment. With half of the public school children identified as African American, and half of them female, there is much opportunity for broadening participation in computing.

A consequence of the existence of non-commuting observables in quantum mechanics is that QL does not satisfy the BL distribution law. Quantum logicians have thus paid much attention to ""quasi""- distributive theorems, one of the better known of which is the Marsden-Herman theorem (MHT).

In this sense, specialized laboratories are necessary in order to carry out this kind of formation and training. However, the lack of specialized laboratories is one of the main obstacles preventing us from reaching this objective. The specialized laboratories require specialized installation, maintenance and cost management as well as a design that can accommodate a large number of students. In contrast, the virtual laboratories are one tool that can be used to deal with both issues which are the lack of specialized engineers and the absence of specialized laboratories.

As the country posits itself as a cyber-island with a fully developed information technology hub, it has become imperative to think about leveraging the teaching of computer science in lower secondary schools (Grades 7-9). So far, this has been limited to basic courses in computing that are essentially theory focused. This paper states that students at this stated level need to develop `computational thinking' so that they are ready for the workplace and will effectively enter the digital world. It limits itself to two key variables resource leveraging and teaching computing. In the first case, it raises arguments on programming languages, hardware and software that might apply to students in the new curriculum.

We consider an OFDM symbol with N subcarriers so that the receiver takes N time samples of the received noisy CO-OFDM signal. Our idea is to first append these N received samples with (L - 1)N zeros at the end to get a sequence of LN time samples. By taking the discrete Fourier transform of these LN samples, we compute the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol at LN discrete frequency points. We think of this spectrum as being made up of L sets of N points each, each set consisting of the frequency points {2π/LN l, 2π/LN l + 2π/N , . . . , 2π/LN l + 2π(N -1)/N}, for each value of l, where l = 0, 1, . . . , L - 1. Each set of N points for one value of l can be considered as the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol corresponding to one hypothesized value 2π/LN l of the CFO. The receiver can now obtain the maximum likelihood (ML) CFO estimate by determining the hypothesized value that best matches the spectrum of the CO-OFDM symbol received from the channel. In the case of data-aided (DA) ML estimation, we treat the OFDM symbol as a pilot symbol in which we know the data in all the subcarriers, and this pilot symbol is used as the reference signal for the MF. In the case of blind (BL) ML estimation, the data in all the subcarriers are unknown, and the receiver uses an OFDM symbol with no data modulation in all the subcarriers as the reference signal. After making the ML decision of the hypothesized value of the CFO, a fine search will be carried out to determine the actual value more accurately. It turns out only one step is necessary to locate the actual value of the CFO. The DA MF ML algorithm can achieve full-range (integral and fractional part) CFO estimation with high accuracy, while the BL MF ML algorithm has low computational complexity but focuses on the fractional CFO estimation only. We discuss the complexity and performance of this MF ML algorithm, and present simulation results to demonstrate the estimation error variance for 16-PSK/QAM modulations. The simulation results show that the estimation error variance of the DA MF ML algorithm can achieve the Cramer-Rao lower bound in the absence of the laser phase noise.","1558-2213","","10.1109/JLT.2018.2828941","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61571316,61302112); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8344419","Carrier frequency offset (CFO);coherent optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (CO-OFDM);matched filter (MF);maximum likelihood (ML)","OFDM;Maximum likelihood estimation;Discrete Fourier transforms;Receivers;Modulation;Optical transmitters","","11","","22","IEEE","20 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is motivated by recent changes in the ABET Criterion 3 accreditation guideline that requires students to demonstrate ""an ability to function effectively on a team whose members together provide leadership, create a collaborative and inclusive environment, establish goals, plan tasks, and meet objectives."" Outside of accreditation guidelines, team-based learning is becoming the prescribed pedagogical tool to enhance student collaboration and prepare them for professional work environments upon graduation. One important factor in effective team-based learning is to ensure teams are balanced in their abilities and characteristics across team members. Demographical memberships of students can also play an important role in team dynamics and impact the overall success in content learning. Instructors usually assign teams to students by manually looking into their abilities from previous grades and other performance factors. This can then become tedious when aiming to maintain uniform heterogeneity in classrooms of students coming from diverse backgrounds of knowledge, skills, ethnicity, and gender. While some studies have presented the use of computer-aided tools, visualization categorization, and other Artificial Intelligence techniques, this work proposes the use of the Genetic Algorithm (GA) to form teams optimized for heterogeneity. The Genetic Algorithm presented uses a discrete integer-based chromosome representation and groups alleles to represent each team. Standard GA operators enable the algorithm to be adapted to any optimizing criteria deemed fit by the instructor. The algorithm presented in this work uses self-reported competency data on 3 different computational skills for 1300 students enrolled in a firstyear engineering design thinking course divided into over 20course sections of strength 40-60 each. Net team scores for each computational tool are calculated and the variation across each skill minimized by the fitness function for individual sections. Constraints based on gender and ethnicity are applied to minimize demographical imbalance between teams. The algorithm is tested for all sections in the Fall 2019 cohort to give consistent team configuration. Discussions on the stability and validity of configurations generated are discussed.

With the nation's continuing shortage of scientists and engineers, there is an urgent need for diverse students, especially Hispanic students, to enter and complete science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education at all levels. Contributing factors to the low representation in STEM areas are the lack of Hispanic youth's exposure to engaging and relevant experiences with science in their early stages of development and the lack of Latino scientists as role models that are visible, tangible, real, and inspiring to their communities. In addition, student experiences in math and science in the middle grades have emerged as a “filter” that prevents many students from pursuing advanced STEM courses in high school and, therefore, limits their knowledge of and interest in exploring STEM subjects and careers later in their education. This paper presents a research-based approach to attract middle school students to STEM fields in a majority Hispanic region, using a game-based learning platform. The platform integrates computational thinking in the area of water conservation at middle-school level by using simulations and data visualization in concurrent learning modules.

Learned weights of models robust to such perturbations are previously found to be transferable across different tasks but this applies only if the model architecture for the source and target tasks is the same. Input gradients characterize how small changes at each input pixel affect the model output. Using only natural images, we show here that training a student model's input gradients to match those of a robust teacher model can gain robustness close to a strong baseline that is robustly trained from scratch. Through experiments in MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet, we show that our proposed method, input gradient adversarial matching, can transfer robustness across different tasks and even across different model architectures. This demonstrates that directly targeting the semantics of input gradients is a feasible way towards adversarial robustness.","2575-7075","978-1-7281-7168-5","10.1109/CVPR42600.2020.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9157203","","Robustness;Task analysis;Training;Computational modeling;Perturbation methods;Impedance matching;Predictive models","","20","","33","IEEE","5 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

When the process is based on a single creative domain such as visual art or audio production, designers primarily take inspiration from work within their domain and refine it based on their own intuitions or feedback from an audience of experts from within the same domain. What happens, however, when the creative process involves more than one creative domain such as in a digital game? How should the different domains influence each other so that the final outcome achieves a harmonized and fruitful communication across domains? How can a computational process orchestrate the various computational creators of the corresponding domains so that the final game has the desired functional and aesthetic characteristics? To address these questions, this paper identifies game facet orchestration as the central challenge for artificial-intelligence-based game generation, discusses its dimensions, and reviews research in automated game generation that has aimed to tackle it. In particular, we identify the different creative facets of games, propose how orchestration can be facilitated in a top-down or bottom-up fashion, review indicative preliminary examples of orchestration, and conclude by discussing the open questions and challenges ahead.","2475-1510","","10.1109/TG.2018.2870876","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466898","Artificial-intelligence (AI)-based game generation;computational creativity;orchestration;procedural content generation (PCG)","Games;Visualization;Generators;Instruments;Art;Creativity;Phonocardiography","","37","","121","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The problem is how to provide not just a sum of knowledge about the individual elements of mathematics, and some holistic system of representations of the world of mathematics. Integral system of ideas about the general properties and regularities of the objective world, a special form of systematization of knowledge is a scientific picture of the world, which is a qualitative generalization and philosophical synthesis of various scientific theories. For mathematical knowledge such a complete system of representations is a mathematical picture of the world. This problem is aggravated by the fact that there is no single point of view on the subject of mathematics, the positions of scientists differ greatly in the ratio of the various components of mathematical knowledge, in particular between discrete and continuous models in mathematics. The purpose of the article is to consider the way of forming an integral mathematical picture of the world. The historical analysis carried out in the article shows that in the history of mathematics there were repeated attempts to disrupt the balance between discrete and continuous models, attempts to reduce mathematics to one of these two types of models. However, in this case it became obvious the destruction of the integrity of the mathematical picture of the world, the need for a new, balanced perspective on the nature of mathematics. This need became especially acute in recent decades due to the growing role and place of discrete sections of mathematics in the context of computerization of society. To solve the problem, the article uses the trinitarian methodology and historical analysis. This methodology is more and more widely used in post-nonclassical outlook recently though sprouts of this thinking arose for a long time. This methodology presupposes the existence of a third element in addition to two binary oppositions, which is necessary for solving the problem of binary contradictions, as a measure of their compromise, as an arbitrator, as a condition for their existence. On the basis of the trinitarian methodology, the article shows that the unity of discrete and continuous models can be provided by the third component - fractal models. Fractality is just as fundamental a structural property of matter as discreteness and continuity. Thus, fractal geometry is not just a new branch of mathematics, it is one of the most important components of the mathematical picture of the world. Thus, with the help of this new scientific direction, it is possible to ensure the unity of discreteness and continuity, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world among the students. Fractality is the fundamental structural property of matter, it is possible to ensure the synergy of discrete and continuous models, to form the integrity mathematical picture of the world. The study of fractal geometry helps to increase the motivation to study mathematics, the convergence of learning and research, enhance the aesthetic appeal of mathematics.","","978-1-5386-9468-8","10.1109/ICAMCS.NET46018.2018.00033","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8955745","mathematical picture of the world;trinitarian methodology;discreteness;continuity;fractality","","","","","20","IEEE","13 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we introduce a new category of computational arguments named M-arguments. M-arguments are not meta-arguments as the name could suggest, they are computational arguments with rich structure. Such a rich structure allows us to represent a large number of computational models of arguments. Further, M-arguments allows us not only to represent the usual structure of arguments, but also to represent relevant information that concerns the dialectic and rhetoric aspects of argumentation.","","978-1-6654-1924-6","10.1109/WIIAT50758.2020.00026","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9457701","Artificial Intelligence;Argumentation;Multi-Agent Systems","Computational modeling;Rhetoric;Cognition;Intelligent agents;Time factors;Artificial intelligence","","3","","42","IEEE","24 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current research on Z-number assumes that differences in various parts of a Z-number can complement one another. However, in many cases, the preference of DMs for each part is difficult to determine, or DMs believe that the differences in various parts cannot be complementary. Therefore, to solve such decision problems, this paper attempts to extend the traditional MABAC method to the Z-information environment by introducing the directed distance and regret theory. The proposed method simultaneously considers the randomness and fuzziness of Z-number.

This is particularly important considering that affect could significantly influence a user's perception of usability. This paper uses image schemas to quantitatively and systematically evaluate both these aspects. It proposes a method for evaluating user experience that is based on using image schemas, sentiment analysis, and computational semantics. The aim is to link the sentiments expressed by users during their interactions with a product to the specific image schemas used in the designs. The method involves semantic and sentiment analysis of the verbal responses of the users to identify (i) task-related words linked to the task for which a certain image schema has been used and (ii) affect-related words associated with the image schema employed in the interaction. The main contribution is in linking image schemas with interaction and affect. The originality of the method is twofold. First, it uses a domain-specific ontology of image schemas specifically developed for the needs of this study. Second, it employs a novel ontology-based algorithm that extracts the image schemas employed by the user to complete a specific task and identifies and links the sentiments expressed by the user with the specific image schemas used in the task. The proposed method is evaluated using a case study involving 40 participants who completed a set task with two different products. The results show that the method successfully links the users' experiences to the specific image schemas employed to complete the task. This method facilitates significant improvements in product design practices and usability studies in particular, as it allows qualitative and quantitative evaluation of designs by identifying specific image schemas and product design features that have been positively or negatively received by the users. This allows user experience to be assessed in a systematic way, which leads to a better understanding of the value associated with particular design features.","1949-3045","","10.1109/TAFFC.2017.2705691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7937927","Affect;computational semantics;image schema;interaction design;ontology;sentiment analysis;usability;user experience","Usability;Product design;Semantics;Sentiment analysis;Tools;Context;Ontologies","","17","","65","CCBY","1 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"The Science and Art Of Decision Making","E. Cepni","Cyprus Health and Social Sciences University, Morphou, Northern Cyprus",2019 IEEE 18th International Conference on Cognitive Informatics & Cognitive Computing (ICCI*CC),"22 Jul 2020","2019","","","272","277","Decision makers of today routinely encounter increasingly complex and interrelated problems, preceding the necessity for a large number of significant decisions to be dynamic in nature. Frequently rather than a single decision the requirement of a number of decisions exists, conventionally being interdependent on each other in an environment of progressive change. For thousands of years people have endeavoured to document observations of the environment and surroundings, with the aspiration of comprehending situations, which in turn enable a form of anticipation or prediction of the future. Through the contributions of a range of scientists and philosophers' humanity has affected the achievement of an improved quality of life, commencement of influence on the essence of life and encouragement to attempt to gain even further knowledge through travel to other planets. Without any doubt science is exceptional and dynamic and by far the optimum means of discovering the world and all that it encompasses. What hasn't changed is the curiosity, imagination and intelligence of those doing science [1]. Despite the fact that scientific discoveries and inventions invariably enhance life to a large degree as well as being accredited with expanding the expected lifespan of humans, scientific and technological improvements may equally precipitate alienation, loss of privacy, environmental problems (chemical and electronic waste), and a greater uncertainty or a black swan event. Science is perceived to be subject about knowledge with curiosity lying at the heart of it, differing from technology in that technology is preferably explained as doing. The 19th century scientist Pierre Laplace elevated determinism to a key place in science. He linked determinism and the ability to predict to the very notion of success in science [2]. For technical decisions science is an unrivalled tool to use, however, for managerial, institutional and personal daily life decisions the same recommendation cannot be given. Numerous key systems incorporated in the life of humans exhibit diverse complexities. Markets compromised of various buyers and sellers all categorized in groups participating in mutual funds, economies with hierarchies of workers, departments, firms, and industries; multi-celled organisms consisting of proteins, membranes, organelles, cells, and organs, the internet with users, stations, servers, and websites. Each of these complex systems exhibits a distinctive property called “emergence” roughly described by a phrase “the whole is more than the sum of the actions of the parts [3]. Scientists depend on the law of rationality; however, the fact that emotion habitually dominates humans on innumerable occasions is well recognized. Perhaps a more effective method for solving the problems of humanity should include deciphering the laws of human nature. As an alternative to the law of rationality, consideration could be given to whether it is preferable for scientists use the law of bounded rationality which may entail radical paradigm shift in scientific studies. The fundamental gap between the explicit accomplishments of knowledge acquisition in the natural sciences versus the rather minimal successes in understanding the dynamics of the social realm is the inherent nonlinearity, instability, and uncertainty of behaviour consistent with social systems. However, the possibility that an alternative strategy exists to close this gap is highly feasible. This article aims at showing the justification for the discarding the rule of rationality assumption in engagement and comprehension of scientific studies, and as a substitute insert human behaviours and emotions. Our emotional self is the principal power behind our creativity and passion and constitutes humanity. Controlling the nature may be easier than controlling the human nature. Today the study of chaos, and systemic thinking (emphasis is given to complexity, networks and patterns of organization) has emerged at the forefront of natural sciences too. Disquiet exists concerning events that may lead to the destruction of our civilization even the elimination of life on Earth. In 2050 the World population will reach 9.7 billion. There is also an urgent need to introduce eco-ethical standards into science. Decision making is not merely a science; there is a requisite for creative and individuality aspects of it to be examined. In the development of technologies, the human nature, psychological and sociological impacts of these technologies must be analysed in a holistic way. The main aim of the paper is to show that decision making especially under uncertainty is partly scientific partly heuristic or artistic phenomenon. The art side of decision making shouldn't be expelled from science.","","978-1-7281-1419-4","10.1109/ICCICC46617.2019.9146085","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146085","complexity neuroeconomics;styling;decision-making","Uncertainty;Decision making;Standards;Mathematical model;Art;Complexity theory","","","","15","IEEE","22 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biomedical engineering enjoys higher rates of women's enrollment than other engineering disciplines, but nevertheless has gender disparities in persistence within the field. Additionally, trends towards greater incorporation of computation into biomedical engineering have the potential to recreate the gender inequities seen in more computationally intensive engineering disciplines. Recently, `engineering identity' has emerged as a powerful analytic lens to understand persistence in engineering, particularly for underrepresented groups such as women. However, there is limited work examining how experiences using computational methods influences engineering identity formation in undergraduate biomedical engineers. Further, it remains unclear to what extent gender differentially mediates the effects of computational practice on engineering identity formation. In order to explore the intersection of these issues, we study a thermodynamics course in the biomedical engineering department of a large Midwestern public research institution in the United States. The thermodynamics course includes in-class computational modeling group activities and has an enrollment of more than 120, primarily sophomore year, undergraduate students. We use a qualitative study approach that includes gathering data through classroom observation and detailed semi-structured interviews. We analyze classroom observation data to try to understand student experiences of learning and participation during in-class computational modeling exercises. Specifically, we look for evidence of gendered differences in task sorting and engagement with the exercise. Classroom data is complemented by semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews gains student's perspectives on how gender has influenced their learning experience and their identity as engineers.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-1746-1","10.1109/FIE43999.2019.9028656","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9028656","computation;engineering identity;gender","","","1","","15","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A computational simulation involving the Stag Hunt game examined information sharing decisions in a series of key decision points in three large case studies. For the five hypotheses tested, exploratory data analysis and nonparametric statistical testing show strong support for three of the hypotheses (cooperation is positively correlated with actors' levels of Sympathy and Trust and negatively correlated with actors' levels of Fear) and moderate support for the fourth (cooperation is negatively correlated with actors' levels of Greed). Indications are that the fifth hypothesis (cooperation is correlated with history of behavior) is not needed to explain observed behavior. Multiple correspondence analysis showed significant interactions both among pairs of forces and when a force is paired with decision making strategies. These results can form the basis for: 1) analysis of additional case studies; 2) development of an agent-based simulation; and 3) creation of training programs for current and future organizational leaders.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2016.2647598","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7829303","Cooperative systems;computational modeling;complex systems engineering;extended enterprise;game theory;institutional analysis;system of systems;systems thinking","Government;System of systems;Ethics;Standards organizations;Data analysis;Information management","","7","","122","IEEE","23 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Moreover, one of the crucial device of the SG architectures is the smart metering systems which utilize high frequencies for the power line communication (PLC) transmission. In particular, the presence of spectral components in the range of 2÷ 150kHz (supraharmonics) has recently become an issue of great interest due to the interaction between widespread diffusion of high-spectral emission devices (e.g., end-user devices and converter-interfaced distributed generation systems) and power line communication systems. The complexity of these waveforms distortions makes their assessment a challenge. This paper critically analyses and compares two methods proposed in recent literature which seem particularly suitable for the spectral analysis of waveforms with wide spectra. One of the methods is based on the sliding-window discrete Fourier transform (SWDFT) referring to IEC standard harmonic estimation. The second method utilizes the sliding-window wavelet-modified ESPRIT-based method (SWWMEM).

The paper concentrates on building an intelligent agent model as a knowledge-based system interacting with dynamic environment to perform tasks. The class structure used to represent the environment in the knowledge base depends on three types of knowledge representation forms: production rule, semantic net, and frames. Each object in the environment is an instance of the class environment. Algorithms and functions are used for gaining knowledge from the state space of environment to build the task. The intelligent agent model can understand the environment from any position and can detect many subtasks, arrange them in a queue for execution, and has the ability to make a decision at a high level of thinking. The intelligent agent model is able to calculate the persistent changes in the external dynamic environment and any sudden change, such as observing the existence of any obstacle in the environment and avoiding it. The intelligent agent is also able to learn and take the reasonable decision in the dynamic environment and automatically select action based on task characteristics. Therefore, the intelligent agent can solve many different types of problems.","","978-1-5386-4427-0","10.1109/CAIS.2018.8442008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8442008","Intelligent agent;dynamic environment;performance","Intelligent agents;Task analysis;Knowledge based systems;Search problems;Engines;User interfaces;Computational modeling","","","","8","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The results showed that the proposed model was able to learn the basic actions and also to generate novel actions by modulating and combining those learned actions. The analysis on the neural activities illustrated that the ability to generate creative actions emerged from the model's nonlinear memory structure self-organized during training. The results also showed that the different way of learning the basic actions induced the self-organization of the memory structure with the different characteristics, resulting in the generation of different levels of creative actions.

From chatbots to robots, human experience in the developed world is moving towards a socio-technical system in which agents can be technological or biological, with increasingly blurred distinctions between. Given that emotion is a key element of human interaction, enabling artificial agents with the ability to reason about affect is a key stepping stone towards a future in which technological agents and humans can work together. This paper presents work on building intelligent computational agents that integrate both emotion and cognition. These agents are grounded in the well-established social-psychological Bayesian Affect Control Theory (BayesAct). The core idea of BayesAct is that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: they strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and general world views as constructed through culturally shared symbols. This affective alignment creates cohesive bonds between group members, and is instrumental for collaborations to solidify as relational group commitments. BayesAct agents are motivated in their social interactions by a combination of affective alignment and decision theoretic reasoning, trading the two off as a function of the uncertainty or unpredictability of the situation. This paper provides a high-level view of dual process theories and advances BayesAct as a plausible, computationally tractable model based in social-psychological and sociological theory.","","978-1-7281-3891-6","10.1109/ACIIW.2019.8925215","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8925215","affect control theory;Markov decision process;free energy;active inference;social order;artificial intelligence","Computational modeling;Cognition;Complexity theory;Intelligent agents;Collaboration;Biological system modeling;Bayes methods","","","","44","IEEE","8 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it requires strong cryptographic security mechanisms, like encryption of communication, to be in place. We motivate the need for strong privacy protection by highlighting privacy issues in a smart home use-case. We advance beyond encryption and discuss which existing techniques can be used to achieve unobservable communication. Then we describe the architecture needed to provide strong protection in this particular use-case. Lastly, we present the building blocks of the architecture we implemented so far on the Re-Mote sensor nodes running Contiki OS and sketch the computational and network overheads imposed by these techniques.","","978-1-5386-4725-7","10.1109/WoWMoM.2018.8449779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8449779","Internet of Things;privacy;network security;cryptography;dc-net;mix;contiki;IoT;DTLS;ECDSA;PAN;WSN","Privacy;Actuators;Encryption;Internet;Smart homes","","6","","51","IEEE","30 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although there are evidences of research on artistic creativity, including painting, music etc., there is hardly any research outcome on the biological basis of scientific creativity. This paper attempts to provide the biological basis of scientific creativity by identifying the brain activation patterns during the mental progress of scientific creation. It explores the scope of inductive learning in the psychological process of scientific concept formation from the commonality of positive instances of inductive learning, and use the formed concept to solve unknown problem, preferably in a new domain. The learning of the subject is monitored by acquiring the N400 brain signal and the correct application of the concept learnt to the unknown problem is detected by P300 event related potential. To identify the brain lobes involved in the learning (and planning) phase, we first trained an interval type-2 fuzzy-neural classifier with known input instances collected from selected (literature-provided) brain lobes and classes defined by N400 (P300) response of the subject. We then test the classifier performance by submitting arbitrarily selected brain lobe patterns as input to the classifier. In case the classifier produces the right class for the given input instance then the arbitrarily selected brain region carries significance in the learning (planning) phases. We declare a brain region responsible for learning/planning and hence creativity, if repeated testing of the region yields favorable outcomes of the pre-trained classifier. Experiments undertaken on 60 pre-college students indicate that pre-frontal and frontal lobes are responsible for inductive learning and prefrontal, parietal and occipital lobes for planning/scientific creativity. We also validate the brain region activation by using e-LORETA software.","","978-1-5386-9276-9","10.1109/SSCI.2018.8628779","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8628779","Scientific creativity;Inductive learning;Type-2 fuzzy neural classifier;P300 and N400 brain signals","Creativity;Planning;Electric potential;Testing;Problem-solving;Painting;Electroencephalography","","3","","31","IEEE","31 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The selection of appropriate classification algorithm for a particular problem is a challenging task, formally known as algorithm selection problem (ASP) in literature. It is increasingly becoming focus of research in machine learning community. Meta-learning has demonstrated substantial success in solving ASP, especially in the domain of classification. Considerable progress has been made in classification algorithm recommendation and researchers have proposed various methods in literature that tackles ASP in many different ways in meta-learning setup. Yet there is a lack of survey and comparative study that critically analyze, summarize and assess the performance of existing methods. To fill these gaps, in this paper we first present a literature survey of classification algorithm recommendation methods. The survey shed light on the motivational reasons for pursuing classifier selection through meta-learning and comprehensively discusses the different phases of classifier selection based on a generic framework that is formed as an outcome of reviewing prior works. Subsequently, we critically analyzed and summarized the existing studies from the literature in three important dimensions i.e., meta-features, meta-learner and meta-target. In the second part of this paper, we present extensive comparative evaluation of all the prominent methods for classifier selection based on 17 classification algorithms and 84 benchmark datasets. The comparative study quantitatively assesses the performance of classifier selection methods and highlight the limitations and strengths of meta-features, meta-learners and meta-target in classification algorithm recommendation system. Finally, we conclude this paper by identifying current challenges and suggesting future work directions. We expect that this work will provide baseline and a solid overview of state of the art works in this domain to new researchers, and will steer future research in this direction.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2964726","Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8951014","Meta-learning;algorithm selection;classification;machine learning","Machine learning algorithms;Task analysis;Classification algorithms;Machine learning;Heuristic algorithms;Clustering algorithms;Space exploration","","58","","90","CCBY","7 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, the “Riconnessioni” project was promoted by the Compagnia di San Paolo in agreement with the Ministry of Education but planned, started and developed by the Foundation for the School. The digital transformation started with a defined strategy that leveraged opportunities presented by new technology while meeting the objectives of system stakeholders. Through several steps, that strategy was developed for education connecting everything to support tomorrow’s digital world and creating strong strategic partnerships able to build an ecosystem connecting people, processes, and things into a powerful, secure, and smart communications network. This paper reports on the three-year Riconnessioni project, which is combining the energies of teachers, managers, administrative staff, students, among others, and experimenting with new learning models, taking advantage of opportunities that emerged from perceptions stemming from concerns and systemic issues. To date, more than 150 schools in Italy have been included in the project, together with 550 teachers selected to scale up the instructional process. Using a methodology called “cascade training”, the 550 selected teachers were able to spread the knowledge to more than 2,600 colleagues. The monitoring and evaluation activity performed in Riconnessioni aims at processing information on implementation and results, following three lines. First, it regularly evaluates project activities from a reporting standpoint. Second, it verifies the plan consistency against implementation achievements. Third, it identifies changes produced and focuses on teachers’ and students’ skills to evaluate the effects of the project. The assessment framework is also discussed in this work, reporting on results regarding feedback, follow-up, and effects gathered from the field. The evaluation highlighted that labs were indeed able to improve teachers’ competence and underlined the added value of cascade training which spread digital domain knowledge and awareness into the group of involved schools.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3018189","Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation; Foundation for the School; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172001","Digital transformation;adaptive learning;computational thinking;computer science;education;information technologies;primary school;secondary school","Digital transformation;Training;Biological system modeling;Business;Cloud computing;Collaboration","","25","","68","CCBY","20 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The learning design was based on situated learning accompanied by a mix of tutorials, teacher explanations and support & collaboration amongst the students. The results of the first iteration of Design-Based Research confirmed the hypotheses that video game development was fascinating and engaging for the majority of young learners. Using a professional tool with an embedded physics engine provided additional attraction for teenagers. From the first cycle of game development we learned that dealing with the complexity of the development environment in a systematic way, time management, advanced teachers' competencies in handling the environment, and providing well balanced learning materials are crucial to successfully employ a professional tool like Unity in secondary education. Besides improved materials and a stepwise process of adding complexity e.g. by starting with developing mini-games, the most important change for the second cycle is to significantly extend the time allocated for game development. This seems justified due to the vast spectrum of skills and competences students tend to acquire when collaborating on complex and exciting issues like developing games.","2165-9567","978-1-5386-9506-7","10.1109/EDUCON.2019.8725135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725135","video game development;engagement;motivation;Unity;learning to code;computational thinking;Design-Based Research;secondary school;K-12 education","Games;Programming profession;Tutorials;Tools","","14","","40","IEEE","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Robotic literacy is integrated or being integrated into the education system for children at an early age all around the world. Most of the teachers in charge of this education lack skills and are left to fend for themselves. This study proposes to focus on the discourses made by teachers and learners during such activities, and especially the metaphors used spontaneously. It takes shape through two robotic literacy activities. The first activity involved the robots BeeBot, BlueBot and Ozobot in seven classes of children from 3 to 10 years old. The second activity consisted of a five half-days training for 13 participants from 8 to 15 years old. They designed, built and programmed a robot. Young people's representations and interactions with robots involved in educational activities are observed to contribute to the development of questions for critical technology education. Analyses are carried out using the conceptual metaphor theory of Lakoff and Jonhson. Three roles are identified: the metaphor that helps to understand, the metaphor that makes tangible, and the metaphor that serves as a catchphrase. A metaphor can take more than one role and, whatever its role, can be classified as a living or non-living metaphor. Using living metaphors may hide aspects of the machine and raises ethical issues, inter alia. It is then essential to deconstruct young people's representations of the machine. This can be achieved by analyzing robots as social constructions that reflect human intentions.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9273959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9273959","Digital Literacy;Robotics;Educational Robot;Computational thinking;Programming;Coding;Early childhood;Elementary Education;Secondary Education;Representations;Understanding;Conceptual Metaphor","Robots;Education;Programming profession;Robot sensing systems;Training;Tools;Mechatronics","","6","","29","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With the above motivation, we conducted 16 semi-structured interviews with instructors who teach introductory programming courses and we also collected diaries kept by 110 students during their studies. The qualitative analysis of these data revealed connections between the studied contents such as dependencies. Our analysis shows that many difficulties arise from the incorrect application of the knowledge necessary in learning new content, usually because the student has not learned earlier topics or learned them superficially.

However, there is a shortage of K-12 teachers with the background, preparation, and experience necessary to teach CS. To build capacity to deliver this instruction, districts must provide teacher preparation that includes not only CS content, but also high-quality pedagogical approaches that will meet the needs of all students enrolled in a wide variety of school settings. In this paper, we explore teacher outcomes across multiple CS professional development opportunities, in one large urban district. The teacher outcomes were measured via a survey administered between eight months and two years after teachers received training to implement CS. Though our findings are from a single district, we believe these findings are relevant to other settings and provide useful information about the outcomes of teacher professional development for CS education, as well as supports and barriers to implementing CS, in a large, urban school system. The results offer insight into professional development quality, teacher confidence, the ability of teachers to implement CS in their classrooms, and supports and barriers to offering CS instruction (even in a district where CS education is a priority). They also shed light on how supports and barriers differ in schools serving students with high economic needs and lower academic performance compared with schools serving students with lower economic needs and higher academic performance. These differences underscore the importance of considering economic need and academic performance (in addition to race and gender) when developing and executing CS for all initiatives.","","978-1-7281-7172-2","10.1109/RESPECT49803.2020.9272418","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9272418","CS4All;K-12 classroom implementation;Teacher survey;Evaluation;Assessment;Computational Thinking;Gender and Diversity;Teacher Development;K-12 Curriculum;K-12 Instruction;Non-traditional Students;Professional Practice","Training;Urban areas;Economics;Encoding;Software engineering;STEM;Programming profession","","2","","19","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Pictograms, ideograms and logograms signify fundamental steps for the later emergence of the linear writing and linear time as history and thought. Binary logic and elementary first order propositional calculus are an important aspect of language and seems to have little in common with the perception of objects in space. Nevertheless, we show that classical logic can be derived from the primeval concept of orientation that has emerged in human cognition during Paleolithic worship activity. From there, all higher thought structures can be developed. Thought is a neuronal filter for the perception of that which is.

However, in this paper, through strict formula derivation, we proved that the normal boundary condition of electrical fields and the continuity equation of electric currents at the medium-metal interface are implicit in the solving process of VSIE with method of moment (MoM). We agree that not the normal component but the tangential component mismatch is responsible for the frequency deviation of VSIE simulation. Furthermore, the singularity treatment of Green's function with singular term extraction is also presented in this paper with strict deduction in special case of model discretization with quadrilateral and hexahedral elements, which would be quite useful for reducing the number of unknowns, improving the matrix condition and enhancing the accuracy for electromagnetic simulation in FSS (frequency selected surface) or IC (integrated circuits) applications.","","978-1-7281-3517-5","10.1109/APMC46564.2019.9038249","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9038249","volume-surface integral equation (VSIE);frequency response;boundary conditions;singularity extraction","Conferences","","","","5","IEEE","19 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.","","978-1-5386-1399-3","10.1109/CIBCB.2018.8404980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8404980","","Dementia;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Timing;Smoothing methods","","33","","31","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some considerations for future implementations of similar approaches are put forward. The students' perceptions collected allowed concluding that using different and complementary teaching tools in project-based learning can be effective in promoting students' learning. The use of such tools may contribute to the development of both technical knowledge of students and of soft skills. For this case study, the results show that the students considered the computer tools useful in promoting and facilitating the construction of knowledge and in developing several competencies, i.e., in developing their learning processes. Nevertheless, a positive attitude and commitment by both the students and the instructors are essential to successful teaching and learning processes.

Among the many criteria that must be considered for data storage in the cloud, access control plays a vital role. Role-based access control (RBAC) is a well-known technique for secure data storage in the cloud. Since the traditional RBAC models are improper for open and decentralized environments, recently, some works have integrated the trust concept into the RBAC model. Nevertheless, they have not fully addressed the required security metrics of a trust-based system. Therefore, in this paper, we first introduce the security goals that should be considered in an efficient trust-based system. Second, we propose a novel trust and reputation based RBAC model that not only can properly withstand the security threats of trust-based RBAC models, but also is scalable as it has reasonable execution time. Third, we evaluate the proposed model using the famous trust network of advogato dataset. Eventually, we compare the proposed model with recently-published ones in terms of mean absolute error, execution time of indirect trust computation, and provided features. The achieved results are indicative of the priority of the proposed model to be employed in real cloud environments.","1558-2183","","10.1109/TPDS.2018.2870652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8466653","Cloud computing;role-based access control (RBAC);reputation;trust management system (TMS)","Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Access control;Memory;Measurement","","52","","29","IEEE","16 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We conduct a critical node analysis on the power network to identify the important buses whose removals are likely to trigger a serious blackout. Based on the results of the critical node analysis, we propose both deterministic and stochastic coupling strategies for an asymmetric CPPS with two subnetworks with unequal sizes, to improve its robustness against both random and intentional cyber-attacks.

The main contribution of this design is eliminating the self-regulation challenge students encounter in similar highly flexible computer-related courses. This is attributed to the introduction of orientation lectures and a competitive element; these may have helped students to achieve their goals on time. Background: The Web server administration course on the master's of the Web engineering program was intended to inculcate a series of competences, such as common administration techniques, procedures to increase security, efficient website deployment, and an introduction to clusters and infrastructure deployment automation. The course generally failed to transmit these competencies effectively; complaints were made about the difficulty of the course and the low applicability of its contents. Intended Outcomes: The design facilitates students finding assessment activities that better suit their profiles or previous experience, and enables them to customize their assessment, thus encouraging them and giving future value to their work. Application Design: The course design maximizes assessment flexibility by providing students with many optional activities from which to choose. It also promotes a healthy competitive spirit to improve student's motivation and results. Findings: Complaints about the difficulty or lack of applicability were no longer made. The course is highly valued by the students, achieving a very high pass rate and average score.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2018.2816571","European Regional Development Fund; Principality of Asturias through Its Science, Technology, and Innovation Plan(grant numbers:GRUPIN14-100); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8329010","Competitivity;computer engineering;course design;flexibility;flipped classroom;master’s students;student assessment","Web servers;Security;Computational modeling;Europe;Creativity;Face","","11","","34","IEEE","30 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This is an interesting problem for underwater robotics, as modeling marine objects is inherently more difficult in sonar images, and training data might not be available apriori. Detection proposals algorithms can be used for this purpose but usually requires a large amount of output bounding boxes. In this paper we propose the use of a fully convolutional neural network that regresses an objectness value directly from a Forward-Looking sonar image. By ranking objectness, we can produce high recall (96 %) with only 100 proposals per image. In comparison, EdgeBoxes requires 5000 proposals to achieve a slightly better recall of 97 %, while Selective Search requires 2000 proposals to achieve 95 % recall. We also show that our method outperforms a template matching baseline by a considerable margin, and is able to generalize to completely new objects. We expect that this kind of technique can be used in the field to find lost objects under the sea.","","978-1-7281-3605-9","10.1109/ECMR.2019.8870959","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8870959","","Proposals;Microsoft Windows;Robots;Sonar detection;Training;Computational modeling","","10","","20","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Early detection of suicidal thoughts can help people to diagnose and get proper treatment in time. Machine Learning and Deep Learning are playing a vital role in this area to automatize Suicidal Ideation detection. In our study, we wanted to take this trend to the next level and proposed a new detection approach with the help of the Transformer models in the language domain. Basically with Transformers we wanted to analyze raw social media posts and classify the indication of suicidal ideation in them. First, we applied BiLSTM(Bidirectional Long Short- Term Memory) and from there took a jump to Transformer models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), ALBERT, ROBERTa and XLNET - a complete robust Transformer model based study. The main advantage of Transformer models is having pre-trained language models. Because of this, these models usually perform better. We found they work far better than conventional Deep Learning architecture like Bi-LSTM in our work.","","978-1-6654-2244-4","10.1109/ICCIT51783.2020.9392692","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9392692","Suicidal Ideation;Transformer Model;Deep Learning;Natural Language Processing","Deep learning;Social networking (online);Computational modeling;Bit error rate;Mental health;Linguistics;Depression","","8","","19","IEEE","6 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The general practice is to ask students to read the case, usually four to eight pages long, prior to the session, and then spend the whole session discussing the case. However, for technology courses, the students are required to learn concepts and apply them using hands-on software tools through lab sessions. Hence, rather than use long cases, that cover the entire session, we need to use mini-cases that are usually one to two pages long. This pedagogy approach allows the class session to be designed with tight integration across the concept presentation lecture, mini-case analysis and hands-on lab session.

So-called firm-to-firm transaction networks are valuable in analyzing a market or an economy. However, such detailed and complete data is seldom available. In this work, we aim at supporting economists by reusing available financial information from different sources at different levels of detail and completeness. With our technique, experts' domain knowledge can be fused together with publicly available information to extract a representative, coherent instance of the transaction network. Supporting underspecification is important, as experts may develop partial econometric models. Our technique fills such blanks by systematically guesstimating missing information. Our approach builds upon formal foundations of satisfiability modulo theories and thus obtained transaction networks respect constraints imposed by domain knowledge and input data sources. We outline a taxonomy of general data types in the domain, and we programmatically construct formal predicates describing them. We demonstrate both guestimation of missing information of a transaction network and validation of external, expert-provided models. Finally, we investigate feasibility and performance of the advocated technique over a fragment of the Austrian economy.","","978-1-7281-1337-1","10.1109/IRI.2019.00017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8843449","Satisfiability Modulo Theories;Financial Transaction Networks;Model Validation;Information Reuse","Biological system modeling;Companies;Computational modeling;Data models;Knowledge engineering;Taxonomy;Finance","","","","17","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The combination of violence and aesthetics in the films creates a sense of paradox, subverting the audience's stereotypes about violence and evoking a new aesthetic experience physically and psychologically. To achieve such complicated aesthetic effects to a new level in the digital era, it is innovative to synthesise the literary theory, aesthetic criticism, cinematic strategies, procedural modelling and creative computation to produce more attractive and experimental stories in the film industry. Computer science facilitates the stylisation of violent films in a narrative, technical and artistic way. The paper will take Freudian psychoanalysis and Kantian aestheticism as the philosophical foundation, present an index system of evaluation and a model to compute the weight of violence and artistic beauty and further measure the effect of aesthetics conveyed by the violence. The application of the model will promote the creativity in the interactive narrative about the aesthetics of violence in films.","","978-1-7281-8915-4","10.1109/QRS-C51114.2020.00111","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9282706","the aesthetics of violence;paradox;philosophy;cinematic strategies;interactive narrative","Computer science;Weight measurement;Films;Computational modeling;Entertainment industry;Software reliability;Indexes","","","","39","IEEE","21 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A clear understanding of this often-overlooked concept is crucial for the healthcare modeling community, which is searching for better stakeholder engagement, value demonstration and quality assessment. To review and categorize this concept for modelers and evaluators, we used the Framework Method to examine 35 purposively sampled studies of agent-based and discrete-event simulation modeling in healthcare operation and policy. Four research orientations emerged in the sampled studies, ranging from academic, unilateral passive stakeholder, unilateral active stakeholder, and multilateral stakeholders. From one orientation to the next, studies engage more stakeholders in more research steps and entail distinct requirements for quality assessment. Our analysis highlights the complexity of healthcare for which the best approach to engage stakeholders, demonstrate value and assess quality depends upon the research orientation.","","978-1-5108-8388-8","10.23919/SpringSim.2019.8732880","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8732880","simulation and modeling;framework analysis;research orientation;pluralism;healthcare","Stakeholders;Analytical models;Hospitals;Computational modeling;Context modeling;Systematics","","","","50","","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Through the literature review, we developed three separate impact models i.e. mobile learning content, higher education institute, and communication technology with separate impact factors. We used pre and post usage survey questionnaires of 60 teachers and 60 learners to evaluate these models. Primarily, they were asked to fill the pre-usage questionnaire with their initial mobile learning experience. Then, they were allowed to use the modified Moodle mobile app and asked to fill the post-usage questionnaire. The results reveal that the most significant influencing factors are, ease of use in mobile learning content, and facilitating conditions for higher education institutes and communication technology models. Finally, we can conclude that users prefer to have easy to use mobile learning content with better service facilities in higher education institutes and communication technologies.","","978-1-7281-8412-8","10.1109/ICAC51239.2020.9357139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9357139","Mobile learning;Higher education;Mobile base teaching;Teacher perspectives;Learner perspectives","Learning systems;Computational modeling;Bibliographies;Education;Communications technology;Mobile applications;Object recognition","","","","33","IEEE","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this study, we have introduced a class activity which can increase student pre-class online engagement and help them better prepare for the in-class activity. During this activity, students are required to work in small groups before in-class activities to answer open-ended questions related to the course learning materials via an online shared document. Based on teachers' duty, there are four stages for implementation of the proposed activity which are: (1) initiation: teacher needs to design open-ended questions and creates online shared editable documents for each group; (2) scaffolding: teacher assists learners in providing responses by checking their editing logs; (3) assessment: students' access to the online shared documents will be suspended and teacher will evaluate students responses; and (4) reflection: teacher will address common issues and propose more challenging questions before the related in-class activities. We have conducted experiments in the third cohort of a flipped general education course on computational thinking and algorithms. Except for the proposed class activity, the first two cohorts of this course have the same design and content in three topics and therefore worked as control groups. Online interaction data of all three cohorts have been collected for a thorough comparison. Results showed that students' average lecture video access rates have improved in the third cohort compared to the first two cohorts by 49 % and 39 % respectively. The percentage of students who never accessed any lecture videos decreased from around 29 % in the first and second cohorts to 6 % in the third cohort where the proposed activity was implemented.

The TSP is built based on two key observations: (1) machine learning workloads exhibit abundant data parallelism, which can be readily mapped to tensors in hardware, and (2) a simple and deterministic processor with producer-consumer stream programming model enables precise reasoning and control of hardware components, achieving good performance and power efficiency. The TSP is designed to exploit parallelism inherent in machine-learning workloads including instruction-level, memory concurrency, data and model parallelism, while guaranteeing determinism by eliminating all reactive elements in the hardware (e.g. arbiters, and caches). Early ResNet50 image classification results demonstrate 20.4K processed images per second (IPS) with a batch-size of one— a $4 \times$ improvement compared to other modern GPUs and accelerators [44]. Our first ASIC implementation of the TSP architecture yields a computational density of more than 1 TeraOp/s per square mm of silicon for its $25 \times 29$ mm 14nm chip operating at a nominal clock frequency of 900 MHz. The TSP demonstrates a novel hardware-software approach to achieve fast, yet predictable, performance on machine-learning workloads within a desired power envelope.","","978-1-7281-4661-4","10.1109/ISCA45697.2020.00023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9138986","","","","39","","62","IEEE","13 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, parallel programming is taught usually in more advanced years of the undergraduate computer courses, due to its supposed prerequisites as sequential programming, operating systems, computer architectures and others. Postponing parallel programming teaching hinder students to apply parallelism other subjects, reducing the probability of these future professionals think on parallel solutions naturally. We executed 05 experiments teaching parallel programming subjects for 252 students. We analyzed whether students without prerequisites could learn parallel programming in the same level verified with students with prior computing knowledge. We used three different teaching methodologies: traditional, Problem Based Learning (PBL), and Team-Based Learning (TBL). The teaching and learning evaluation took into account such metrics: parallelism thinking of students, use of programming-model, correct output of the program, source-code readability and satisfaction of the students.

To support the requirements of such paradigm in terms of memory and computation, joint and real-time deep co-inference framework with IoT synergy was introduced. However, the distribution of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) has drawn attention to the privacy protection of sensitive data. In this context, various threats have been presented, including black-box attacks, where a malicious participant can accurately recover an arbitrary input fed into his device. In this paper, we introduce a methodology aiming to secure the sensitive data through re-thinking the distribution strategy, without adding any computation overhead. First, we examine the characteristics of the model structure that make it susceptible to privacy threats. We found that the more we divide the model feature maps into a high number of devices, the better we hide proprieties of the original image. We formulate such a methodology, namely DistPrivacy, as an optimization problem, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference, the privacy level of the data, and the limited-resources of IoT participants. Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce an online heuristic that supports heterogeneous IoT devices as well as multiple DNNs and datasets, making the pervasive system a general-purpose platform for privacy-aware and low decision-latency applications.","2576-6813","978-1-7281-8298-8","10.1109/GLOBECOM42002.2020.9322470","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9322470","IoT devices;distributed DNN;privacy;sensitive data;black-box;resource constraints","Privacy;Image segmentation;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Automobiles;Surveillance;Servers","","12","","14","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In reality, however, social interaction takes place not only between pairs of individuals as in the graph model, but rather in the context of multi-user groups. Research has shown that such group dynamics can be better modeled through a more general hypergraph model, resulting in the need to build scalable hypergraph processing systems. In this paper, we present MESH, a flexible distributed framework for scalable hypergraph processing. MESH provides an easy-to-use and expressive application programming interface that naturally extends the ""think like a vertex"" model common to many popular graph processing systems. Our framework provides a flexible implementation based on an underlying graph processing system, and enables different design choices for the key implementation issues of partitioning a hypergraph representation. We implement MESH on top of the popular GraphX graph processing framework in Apache Spark. Using a variety of real datasets and experiments conducted on a local 8-node cluster as well as a 65-node Amazon AWS testbed, we demonstrate that MESH provides flexibility based on data and application characteristics, as well as scalability with cluster size. We further show that it is competitive in performance to HyperX, another hypergraph processing system based on Spark, while providing a much simpler implementation (requiring about 5X fewer lines of code), thus showing that simplicity and flexibility need not come at the cost of performance.","","978-1-7281-0218-4","10.1109/IC2E.2019.00-11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8790188","Hypergraph Processing System;Distributed Processing System","Computational modeling;Manganese;Cluster computing;Scalability;Partitioning algorithms;Sparks;Social networking (online)","","11","","36","IEEE","8 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The emergent behaviour of the whole software system is then induced by local computations deployed within each node and by the dynamics of the information diffusion. A relevant example of this distribution model is given by aggregate computing and its companion language field calculus, a minimal set of purely functional constructs used to manipulate distributed data structures evolving over space and time, and resulting in robustness to changes. In this paper, we study the convergence time of an archetypal and widely used component of distributed computations expressed in field calculus, called gradient: a fully-distributed estimation of distances over a metric space by a spanning tree. We provide an analytic result linking the quality of the output of a gradient to the amount of computing resources dedicated. The resulting error bounds are then exploited for network design, suggesting an optimal density value taking broadcast interferences into account.

However, mobile devices may not be able to satisfy the computing requirements. Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is proposed to address these issues. Mobile devices offload the computing tasks to the edge servers which accept tasks and handle them. And we think the edge servers should accomplish tasks as many as possible while minimizing total energy cost. However, users with mobile devices are usually keeping moving. In this situation, the energy consumption of tasks are constantly changing, and we need an efficient algorithm to dynamically determine how to offload tasks to a set of edge servers, to maximize the number of completed tasks while minimizing the energy consumption. The dynamic decision of task offloading is a multi-stage decision problem, and therefore we can model this problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Because this problem involves a huge state space with high dimension, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based mobile device task offloading algorithm to solve this problem. We also run extensive experiments to evaluate our task offloading approach against other typical task offloading approaches. The results of experiments show that our algorithm is superior to the baseline algorithms.","","978-1-6654-1485-2","10.1109/ISPA-BDCloud-SocialCom-SustainCom51426.2020.00051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9443981","Mobile Edge Computing;Task Offloading;Deep Reinforcement Learning","Energy consumption;Heuristic algorithms;Computational modeling;Reinforcement learning;Markov processes;Mobile handsets;Servers","","","","16","IEEE","4 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This talk offers thoughts and considerations for active researchers to ponder and appreciate in the context of their research programs. From a perspective on current stages of technology development, and looking toward the progress horizon from that vista, the talk discusses a number of topics within the SACI 2019 scope using examples from research projects and deployed systems. Aspects of intelligent robotics associated with different domains and applications are discussed such as planetary robotics, disaster response and wearable robotics. Also addressed are future considerations for the evolution of related technology toward increased robotic autonomy and advanced intelligence for robotic systems. Motivating this discourse are multiple considerations for next-level robotic intelligence such as enhancing perception capabilities beyond the visual modality, moving beyond object recognition and grasping to knowledge and reasoning about object properties, enabling smart human-collaborative robots that are responsive to intuitive, physical, and brain-interfaced interaction, advancing from robot learning for X (perception, control, etc.) to autonomous or developmental learning and knowledge or skill transfer, the need to realize smart behavior for not only singular robots but for multi-robot systems, and some of the related systems engineering considerations.

The reliability of this method is verified using synthetic data and observed waveforms recorded at land seismic stations in Shandong Province, China. Our extensive synthetic tests show that our new method is little affected by a thin sedimentary layer that has a low S-wave velocity. The orientations of OBS stations that we deployed in the Yap subduction zone in the Western Pacific Ocean are estimated and corrected using our new method. After the correction, the direct P waves of teleseismic receiver functions show very good consistency. The effects of white and coloured noise in different levels, epicentral distance and backazimuth are also investigated, and the results show that these factors have small effects on the new method. We also examine the effect of sensor tilting on estimation of the OBS orientation, and find that a tilting correction should be made before the misorientation correction. We compare the OBS orientations determined with the new method and other methods and find that they are generally consistent with each other.

The conventional methods for checking the correctness of a sentence are normally carried out by applying various syntactic and semantic rules and the rules are endless because of the free word order nature of the Assamese language. On the other hand, in the computational filed, the data-driven models are more appropriate than the rule-based system and the data-driven model is free from the rules.

The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. Human brain is a learning system. Human have to learn by getting exposed to something. This capability of learning system to recognize new patterns is called generalization. The abilities of human brain to perform generalization are yet to be matched by neural network or even by any of artificial intelligence algorithm in general. Thus, the need for new machine intelligence approach is imperative. Neural network is designed to take advantages of the speed of computers to solve engineering and computational complex problems intelligently. On the other hand, human brain is somewhat not computationally powerful. Human brain is not even able to calculate quadratic problems within milliseconds. Instead, it uses its vast amounts of memory to store everything human know and have learned. According to a modern neuroscience theory named memory-prediction framework, introduced by Hawkins and Blakeslee in 2005, human brain uses this memory-based model to make continuous predictions of future events. Therefore, a hybrid approach that possesses the ability to compute like neural network and at the same time think like human brain will shed some light in the advancement of machine learning research as well as the development of a truly intelligent machine. This talk discusses the memory-prediction framework and proposes simplified single cell assembled sequential hierarchical memory (s-SCASHM) model instead of hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) in order to speed up the learning convergence. s-SCASHM consists of single neuronal cell (SNC) model and simplified sequential hierarchical superset (SHS) platform. The SHS platform is designed by simplifying to have a region with four rows columnar architecture instead of having six rows per region as in human neocortex. Then, the s-SCASHM is implemented as the prediction engine of user behavior analysis tool to detect insider attacks/anomalies. As nearly half of incidents in enterprise security triggered by the Insider, it is important to deploy more intelligent defense system to assist the enterprise be able to pinpoint and resolve any incidents caused by the Insider or malicious software (malware). The attacks evolve; however, current detection systems that use the deep learning techniques cannot perform online (on-the-fly) learning. Thus, an intelligent detection system with on-the-fly learning capability is required. Experimental results show that the proposed memory model is able to predict user behavior traffic with significant level of accuracy and performs on-the-fly learning.","","978-602-0737-62-1","10.23919/EECSI50503.2020.9251295","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9251295","","Computer science;Computational modeling;Biological neural networks;Behavioral sciences;Predictive models;Microprocessors;Malware","","","","","","12 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The human brain handles big data in all its forms very efficiently and almost instantaneously, no matter what is the granularity of the data. The idea behind the field of processing big data is to mimic the manner in which the natural brain works and handles big data. All the fields and subfields of machine intelligence are based on identifying and mimicking the natural methods which are used by mother nature to handle big data. The current trends are mainly moving towards processing big data using the cloud infrastructure and machine learning techniques.

The future trends of big data are being applied to such techniques as microprocessors processing big data in a robot’s-brain to plan its actions, express emotions and ultimately to think like a human being.","","978-1-7281-0211-5","10.1109/COMITCon.2019.8862433","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8862433","Data Analytics;MapReduce;Big Data;Artificial Intelligence;Cloud Computing;Cyber Security;IoT","Big Data;Market research;Real-time systems;Companies;Machine learning;Cloud computing","","4","","28","IEEE","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, it is not so. Not only the elderly people, who were born before the 2nd world war, but even GenZ people can be afraid of the speed and scope of ICT and modern technology taking over territories of their lives [1]. Of course, there is a substantial part of people who are eagerly looking forward the future fully automatized, and there are others, who simply don't care. But there is a significant group of people, who are not prepared for automatization, who simply do not trust robots and autonomous systems in their lives.

IT services companies employed students with no IT background and trained them in their in house academies in order to respond fast to their contractual obligations. The time frame to form IT operations specialists is very narrow so they need to think of new strategies to speedup their training. In this sense auto-generative learning objects as the second generation of learning objects are a potential solution since it allows autonomous learning anytime during the day, when queuing, in the subway or during school or job breaks. Learners are trained with automatically generated dynamic content, get automatic evaluation of their responses and receive dynamic feedback. Thus, they can exercise autonomously different learning situations benefiting from automatic evaluation.","","978-1-5386-4640-3","10.1109/SACI.2018.8441004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8441004","","Linux;Operating systems;Load modeling;Browsers;Computers;Libraries;Europe","","5","","10","IEEE","23 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The forgery detection has various techniques like active and passive techniques, moreover the properties like analysis, classification etc, are used to identify the forgery. The work presented in this paper is based on cloning forgery detection. The cloning forgery technique is one of the type of forgery detection techniques in which some area of the image is copied and moved to some another area of the same image which is not easy for the naked eyes to detect easily. The PCA (Principle Component Analysis) technique is used to find the mismatched pixels from the image. In the presented work, the GLCM (Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix) technique is applied with the PCA for the forgery detection. The proposed work is implemented in MATLAB and results are analyzed in terms of PSNR, Recall, Precision and accuracy. In the presented work, the results are better due to less fault rate or able to recover two different attacks (Gaussian noise and motion blur). It is analyzed that the proposed algorithm performs well as compared to the existing algorithm.

If the doctor under duty fails to keep the airway open, it may lead to death or permanent bodily harm of patient, because of inadequate oxygenation. There is no readily available software solutions at present for predicting the exact probability of difficulty in mask ventilation and/or endotracheal intubation. Hence there is an urgent need to develop an expert system solution to support the anesthesiologists in predicting the risk and think about the remedial approaches to prevent the future consequences. The hard dealing with the advancement of a uniform categorization of patient safety has hindered the current advances in patient safety.

After providing the snapshot of classical AHP and its fuzzy extensions, we propose the framework of hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP, which shows how to yield a decision for qualitative decision-making problems with complex linguistic expressions. First, the comparative linguistic expressions over criteria or alternatives are transformed into hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements and then the hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) are constructed. Considering that HFLPRs may be inconsistent, we conduct consistency checking and improving processes after obtaining priorities from the HFLPRs based on a linear programming method. Regarding the consistency-improving process, we develop a new way to establish a perfectly consistent HFLPR. The procedure of the hesitant fuzzy linguistic AHP is given in stepwise.

FCM is a graphical modeling technique that follows a reasoning approach similar to the human reasoning and the decision-making process. The FCM model incorporates the available knowledge and expertise in the form of concepts and in the direction and strength of the interactions among concepts. One of the modeling problems of FCMs is that oversized FCM models suffer from interpretability problems. An oversized FCM may contain concepts that are semantically similar and affect the other concepts in a similar way. This new study introduces a two-stage model reduction approach, and both static and dynamic analyses are considered without losing essential information. In the first stage, the number of concepts is reduced by merging similar concepts into clusters, whereas in the second stage the transformation function parameters of concepts are optimized. In order to show the benefit of using the proposed reduction approach, two sets of studies are conducted. First, a huge set of synthetic FCMs are generated, and the results of these statistical analyses are presented via various tables and figures. Subsequently, suggestions to the decision makers are given. Second, experimental studies are also presented to show the decision parameters and procedure for the proposed approach.

Currently, fuzzy Petri nets (FPNs) cannot describe fuzzy nondeterministic knowledge based on the variable fuzzy criterion clearly. To solve this problem, we present an extended FPN model based on the qualitative mapping and the qualitative criterion transformation. First, the mechanism and the principles of the variable fuzzy criterion under qualitative mapping are introduced. The important theoretical basis of qualitative mapping is detection and integration of perceptual attribute features. Under transition degree function and the qualitative criterion transformation, the qualitative mapping better reflects the cases in which the fuzzy membership criterion is variable. Second, we use the characteristics of the qualitative mapping to propose a structure of attribute fuzzy information granule.

Nevertheless, most of them just think over one-dimension resource allocation, radio resources or computation resources, and make the MEC system less effective. Hence, we consider the allocation of both radio resources and computation resources of the MEC server to increase system effectiveness. Apart from this, we take the variety of tasks' requirements into account. That is, we assume that different tasks may have different delay requirements. We formulate this problem as a cost minimization problem and design a heuristic algorithm to address it.

""Low-Cost Computing"" is a method aimed at achieving the same level of performance of expensive commercial equipment or dedicated equipment by combining common, inexpensive equipment, software and services. One example of ""Low-Cost Computing"" is ""virtual currency"". Virtual currency often uses ""distributed network"" as an underlying technology. In a distributed network, data is stored using users' computers rather than a server for centralized data management. In short, virtual currency is realized by using the network to combine the users' computers. We think of this as ""Network-Based Low-Cost Computing"". There are many services using ""Network-Based Low-Cost Computing"", and they are becoming the mainstream of modern computers. As opposed to this, we propose ""Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing"" in this research. ""Infrastructure-Based Low-Cost Computing"" proposed in this research means ""combining commonly available devices and software to propose an environment for teleconference or remote class, and building an infrastructure with equivalent functionality to expensive systems or services"". In this research, as the first step of this method, we aim to construct, with ""Low-Cost Computing"", a low-cost remote class environment which anyone can use. In this paper, we constructed a remote class environment with ""Low-Cost Computing"", and held classes at Toyo University. At the end of the remote class session, we conducted a survey on the remote class constructed in this research.

With the help of Smartphones as an information technology tool, today can simplify the calculation of a flat build. In this study will be presented the use of computer vision to calculate several types of flat shapes. The automatic calculation of the flat shape formula becomes a solution to calculate quickly to correct the answers to mathematical questions about regular or irregular flat shapes. The calculation process is done by detecting a flat shape that is taken using a Smartphone camera. Once detected, the image is converted into a binary image. Then the measurement of each pixel in the object image is measured, then the formula to be used and the calculation are processed by the application submitted. This study will utilize the Chain Code technique as a digital image processing which functions to generate codes in the form of several numbers based on the direction of the wind. This chain code can represent curves, lines, or contours of a field, determine circumference and area, and can determine the form factor of an object. From this method, it is used to detect objects and then scaling the size of objects so that the formula of the flat building that will be identified can be applied.

But for cloud system, encrypted data processing is not a big deal because of massive processing power of cloud systems. So encryption will not be an obstacle and degrade the performance to process encrypted Big Data at cloud.

Some studies analyze the teaching practices, some compare technologies, and others evaluate the kits in a pedagogical way. However, it is essential to investigate all these contexts together in order to improve the impact produced by the ER in education and to know the best teaching practices associated with the most powerful technologies. The objective of this Research Full Paper is to identify: a) environments and programming languages adopted in the LEGO® Robotics context, b) educational practices applied during classes based on LEGO® Robotics, and c) the educational levels in which robotics has been applied with positive results.

Researchers have used written text as a medium to examine political discourse and analyze value-motivated groups. Previous works showed that computational linguistic analysis can be performed to infer the flexibility of value-motivated groups from their writings. The main premise of these works is that text can bring insights into individuals' and groups' way of thinking, and potentially, behaviour. While existing works provide viable solutions for characterizing groups' ideological behaviour, they perform their analyses over all text published by the groups. However, researchers have found that religious and value-motivated groups can't be analyzed collectively as they regularly evolve. To address this gap, we analyze the performance of existing methods to single documents. Experimental results show that previous features (e.g., use of pronouns and judgment statements) used to predict groups' flexibility are less predictive for single documents' flexibility. We show that a newly added feature regarding the identity of a group provides a significant contribution to the prediction process. Furthermore, due to the unbalanced nature of our data, we propose a weighting scheme for linear regression based on the inter-group variance. Results indicate that a weighted least squares significantly outperforms a traditional least squares approach. This work brings new insights into the characteristics of different linguistic and performative signals, and their relationship to the linguistic flexibility of groups. It also provides a decision making support tool for practical use by practitioners.","","978-1-5386-5035-6","10.1109/BigData.2018.8622319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8622319","longitudinal models;linguistic flexibility;weighted least squares","Linguistics;Feature extraction;Data science;Air pollution;Organizations;Decision making;Tools","","","","21","IEEE","24 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, novice teachers are currently facing critical challenges when delivering subject knowledge that relates to algorithms, programming and the development of computational thinking skills without the benefit of others' experience. After a study of the relevant literature, it could be seen that far too little attention has been paid to the capturing and sharing of TPs which are not easily expressed or communicated in visual or verbal terms. Thus, we design and then demonstrate a Teaching Practices Management System (TPMS) which supports the capturing of TPs. A quantitative and a qualitative evaluation of users' experiences of employing the system shows that instructors are satisfied with it and are mostly positive about its features.

However, prior work in collaborative virtual reality (VR) systems has rarely explored the design space of multi-user layouts and interaction modes with virtual whiteboards. In this paper, we present CollaboVR, a reconfigurable framework for both co-located and geographically dispersed multi-user communication in VR. Our system unleashes users’ creativity by sharing freehand drawings, converting 2D sketches into 3D models, and generating procedural animations in real-time. To minimize the computational expense for VR clients, we leverage a cloud architecture in which the computational expensive application (Chalktalk) is hosted directly on the servers, with results being simultaneously streamed to clients. We have explored three custom layouts – integrated, mirrored, and projective – to reduce visual clutter, increase eye contact, or adapt different use cases. To evaluate CollaboVR, we conducted a within-subject user study with 12 participants. Our findings reveal that users appreciate the custom configurations and real-time interactions provided by CollaboVR.

It not only harms human health, but also affects quality of work and life. Therefore, the choice of a suitable treatment is badly important for patients. In this paper, a novel selection model of treatments for cholecystitis based on hybrid multiple-criteria group decision-making (MCGDM), which is helpful to choose the most suitable treatment in the case of asymmetric information between doctors and patients. Subsequently, subjective and objective criteria are comprehensively taken into account in the index system of the selection model for cholecystitis, and combines 2-tuple linguistic with quantitative data analysis. Besides, the evaluation information obtained from the patient's conditions, the treatment and the hospital's medical status, etc., including real numbers, interval numbers, and linguistic labels with multi-granularity, is more complete and real. And the 2-tuple linguistic model is used to unify the non-homogeneous information, so the treatment selection is accurate and reliable. Simultaneously, for the unknown index and criteria weight, the improved entropy weight method and the BWM (best-worst-method) are utilized to figure out the index weight and criteria weight, respectively. Further, TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese for interactive and multi-criteria decision-making model) method based on the prospect theory is applied to solve the prioritization of cholecystitis treatments, and give full consideration to the decision maker of risk aversion. Eventually, an empirical study of treatment selection for cholecystitis is conducted. Sensitivity analysis and comparative analysis indicate that the proposed selection model of treatments for cholecystitis patients is reliable and effective.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2939211","Key Projects of Hunan Social Science Achievement Evaluation Committee(grant numbers:XSP2016040508,XSP18ZD1002,XSP19ZDA009,XSP19ZDA010); Human Philosophy Social Science Fund(grant numbers:18YBA150); Key Project of Hunan Education Department(grant numbers:18A201); Think Tank Project of Hunan Social Sciences Federation(grant numbers:ZK2019006); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province(grant numbers:2019JJ40088,2019JJ40479); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8822928","Cholecystitis;best-worst method (BWM);entropy weight method;2-tuple linguistic;group decision-making (MCGDM);TODIM","Decision making;Linguistics;Indexes;Hospitals;Surgery;Entropy;Computational modeling","","8","","59","CCBY","3 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But only by using the prediction results of the first layer weak classifier to train the second layer classifier, it has a strong limitation, only considers the training of the classification result and ignores the semantic information. We think that the method of training the weak classifier by TFIDF to the document, the expression of the document is not enough, only the information about the frequency of the document and the document is lack of the semantic information of the word2vector.

To test this, an activity related to crystal structures, similar to what students would see in an introductory level MSE course, was administered to a group of students with varying knowledge levels in MSE. Each participant completed the same worksheet in either VR or on paper. The testing group was composed of seven students, which was too small of a sample size to draw definitive conclusions, yet significant observations could be made. On questions that required recall of prior knowledge, participants using paper-based activities generally performed better, whereas on questions requiring more spatial reasoning and critical thinking, VR participants generally performed better. Most of the participants reported enjoying the VR activities and platform, indicating high usability. These results suggest that VR may be beneficial in teaching complex spatial concepts.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8659267","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8659267","Virtual Reality;Engineering;Education;Materials;Science","Materials science and technology;Virtual reality;Crystals;Education;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Computational modeling","","7","","11","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In view of the traditional centroid localization algorithm is vulnerable to the influence of network deployment status, and the present situation of low positioning precision, put forward an improved centroid localization algorithm. Firstly, put the thinking of weight to the process of node coordinates' calculation, introduce the concept of reference anchor nodes. Then design the weighting strategy accordingly, using the weighted results as the unknown nodes' estimated coordinates, and improve the positioning accuracy through multiple weights. Finally, use simulation experiment to compare the accuracy and stability of the improved algorithm with the classical one. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional algorithm, the improved algorithm's localization accuracy is higher.","","978-1-5386-5373-9","10.1109/ITOEC.2018.8740471","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8740471","wireless sensor network (WSN);location technique;centroid localization algorithm;weighting","Wireless sensor networks;Distance measurement;Analytical models;Information science;Stability analysis;Hardware;Computational complexity","","6","","5","IEEE","21 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So this technique is very useful in user’s daily life. One of the factors for cloud computing is cloud services which were provided by the cloud (IAAS, PAAS, and SAAS). These services enable users to access infrastructure, platform and software. Even resources are allocated to users according to their requirements. But many people think it is unsafe to use cloud resources and its services. It is unsafe to use cloud because there is no guarantee of information which is controlled or maintained by the vendors. There are some security issues that are noticed in cloud computing. In this paper, we have discussed a few issues with cloud computing and the challenges of cloud computing.

Our method first computes the visual feature vector of relation words based on deep networks, and then achieve the visual similarity matrix for all relation words, which we think reflects their true semantics. VS-Word2Vec model then combines the visual similarity and the CBOW and builds an optimization problem to jointly learn the word vector representation. Therefore, VS-Word2Vec fuses the visual modality and natural language together. Experiments implemented over the public datasets demonstrate that VS-Word2Vec model really changes the distribution of word representation and achieves more effective results in describing their true semantics than CBOW model.","","978-1-5386-9245-5","10.1109/IRC.2019.00075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8675640","vector representation, visual supervision, deep learning.","Visualization;Semantics;Computational modeling;Natural languages;Vocabulary;Task analysis;Optimization","","2","","12","IEEE","28 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, it is natural and appropriate to rely heavily on vision analysis for autonomous driving, as done in most projects. However, there is a significant difference between the common approach of vision in autonomous driving, and visual perceptions in humans when driving. Essentially, image analysis is often regarded as an isolated and autonomous module, which high level output drives the control modules of the vehicle. The direction here presented is different, we try to take inspiration from the brain architecture that makes humans so effective in learning tasks as complex as the one of driving. There are two key theories about biological perception grounding our development. The first is the view of the thinking activity as a simulation of perceptions and action, as theorized by Hesslow. The second is the Convergence-Divergence Zones (CDZs) mechanism of mental simulation connecting the process of extracting features from a visual scene, to the inverse process of imagining a scene content by decoding features stored in memory. We will show how our model, based on semi-supervised variational autoencoder, is a rather faithful implementation of these two basic neurocognitive theories.","1849-2266","978-1-7281-3140-5","10.1109/ISPA.2019.8868473","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8868473","mental imagery;deep learning;autonomous driving;variational autoencoder","Decoding;Visualization;Computational modeling;Automobiles;Autonomous vehicles;Lighting;Signal processing","","1","","23","IEEE","17 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, it has been widely applied in mechanical theorem proving, robot, intelligent planning, etc. However, the reasoning process of traditional Prolog is inefficient since it requires a lot of backtracking. This paper presents a novel linear reduction model different from the previous prolog derivation--generalized and/or graph search model, which can clearly represent variable (binding) constraints, so no backtracking is needed. In this model, a successful derivation of Prolog corresponds to a solution sub-graph of the corresponding generalized and/or graph. Therefore, the prolog reasoning is transformed into a searching process without backtracking, which can be parallel executed and greatly improves the efficiency of the prolog deduction. Furthermore, we discuss the transformation of artificial intelligence heuristic search technology, which is mature in both theory and practice, to Prolog reasoning, and obtain a more effective algorithm.","","978-1-7281-1410-1","10.1109/ICCCBDA.2019.8725650","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8725650","artificial intelligence;Prolog reasoning;parallel model;generalized and/or graphs;mechanical theorem proving;heuristic search","Cognition;Parallel processing;Computational modeling;Search problems;Production;Artificial intelligence;Heuristic algorithms","","1","","14","IEEE","30 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We discuss a queuing network technique for computer systems in finite input source. The finite number of terminals exist in the network and a job in the network moves to the server that includes CPU, I/O equipment and memory after think-time at the terminal. When the job arrives at the server, it acquires a part of memory and executes CPU and I/O processing in the server. After the job completes CPU and I/O processing, it releases the memory and goes back to its original terminal. However, when the computer system has the memory resource, the queuing network model has no product form solution and cannot be calculated the exact solutions. We proposed here an approximation queuing network technique for calculating the performance measures of computer systems with finite input source on which multiple types of jobs exist. This technique involves dividing the queuing network into two levels; one is ""inner level"" in which a job executes CPU and I/O processing, and the other is ""outer level"" that includes terminals and communication lines. By dividing the network into two levels, we can prevent the number of states of the network from increasing and approximately calculate the performance measures of the network. We evaluated the proposed approximation technique by using numerical experiments and clarified the characteristics of the system response time and the mean number of jobs in the inner level.","","978-1-7281-3323-2","10.1109/INFOCT.2019.8710860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8710860","performance evaluation;queuing network;central server model;finite input source","Servers;Computer performance;Markov processes;Computational modeling;Time factors;Mathematical model;Lattices","","","","7","IEEE","13 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Organized for Cycles of Change","S. Greenstein","Harvard Business School, Boston, MA, US",IEEE Micro,"21 Dec 2018","2018","38","6","86","88","The author discusses the following questions about the IT market: Why is the commercial IT market organized unlike other markets? That is more challenging to answer than you would think. The IT market seems to change more quickly than other industries, and it seems to use frontier technologies more often. Neither trait is unique to IT, however, financial markets change quickly. Biotech uses frontier technology. Why does the presence and combination of quick change and frontier technology seem so special to the organization of IT markets? Here is a related puzzle. Over the last five decades, many parts of computing and networking have become compartmentalized into submarkets. Specialists inhabit each category and sometimes work with specialists in other categories, and sometimes not. Sometimes a single firm works in many of those submarkets, and sometimes many independent entrepreneurs do. While compartmentalization itself is not unique to IT - the automobile supply chain possess similar features, for example - the IT market witnesses frequent rearrangement of those categories, and the leading firms therein. Sometimes it is orderly and sometimes not. How did it get to be that way? The combination of technical interdependence and technical improvement in fundamental components results in frequent restructuring and mismatches. Difficult to manage, and always entertaining to watch, no other market behaves this way. Two decades ago all the energy went into adjudicating potential abuses of leadership at Microsoft and Intel. Two decades earlier it was IBM. These days the focus stares at Alphabet/Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. That kind of rapid turnover in leadership happens in no other market.","1937-4143","","10.1109/MM.2018.2877220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585395","","Protocols;Computational modeling;Integrated circuit modeling","","","","0","IEEE","21 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The perception style is concerned with the way our minds usually focus attention regarding sensory inputs from the external environment as well as internal influences. The Integrated model of mind (IMM) is a psychological model that describes how encoding processes take place differently by various memory systems according to perception style preferences. The present work shows a cognitive model for perception in light of the ISI and IMM. It suggests a different encoding sequence performed by the different memory systems that correspond to each of the four perception styles identified by the ISI. The model was then converted into an applicable form; an electronic device (embedded system) that would help to identify the different types of memory systems and the image schema produced by any person according to his score on the ISI. The electronic device could be regarded as the mental finger print identifier for any person and could be perfectly used to manage memory and learning problems and to explore mental abilities and powers. It is made up of three main parts: the Atmega32 microcontroller, LCD AlphaNumeric 20×4 LM044L and Keypad 3×3 and programed using the C-language then simulated using Proteus Design Suite.

The core idea of CBR is using past experience and expert knowledge to solve new problems. Operation planning of helicopter mainly relies on the experiences of the decision-maker, so CBR is an effective reasoning technology which can be used in the operation planning. Two key issues, evaluation method and case adaptation, are widely focused in CBR method. However, the existing CBR is not suitable for non-numeric optimization problem such as operation planning, because it belongs to small sample size problem. To solve this problem, the comprehensive evaluation based multi-CBR (CEB-mCBR) method is proposed in this paper, which can be used for operation planning of helicopter. According to the comprehensive evaluation theory, similar historical case set of the target case is established, and the historical operation plans are ranked. On this basis, the optimum initial plan for the target case is generated by the case screening CBR model. Then the solution element screening CBR model is further put forward to solve the issue of case adaptation. The CEB-mCBR method comprises multi-CBR (case screening CBR and solution element screening CBR) and combination evaluation method. It can integrate expert experience and human thinking better, especially when solution space is limited. Finally, through a case study analysis, the multi-CBR model can generate a feasible solution for the target case, and the solution elements can be adjusted according to the situation in the actual operation, which can improve the efficiency of operation planning while keeping the safety, economy and operating efficiency.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3004927","Research Project from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9125912","Comprehensive evaluation;case adaptation;helicopter;multi-CBR;operation planning","Planning;Adaptation models;Helicopters;Indexes;Task analysis;Cognition","","5","","38","CCBY","25 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach was based on the assumption that neurons in-vivo acted just like simple transistors in-silico. Unfortunately, both network and whole-brain modeling based on this premise have led to very little insight into actual brain function. The evidence for this claim is two-fold. First, the amount of energy needed to operate computing machinery that isn't anywhere near as complex as the human brain still requires much more energy than the latter. Second, because transistor-based computing reacts to static events whilst neurons can react to processes, properties inherent to computing architectures hardware prevent the true level of complexity and connectivity achieved in the human brain from being realized in-silico. In contrast to transistors, neurons can establish and change their connections and vary their signaling properties according to a variety of rules, allowing them to adapt to circumstances, self-assemble, auto-calibrate and store information by changing their properties according to experience (Laughlin & Sejnowski, 2003). In this speech, we elaborate on this evidence, and argue that there is a need to re-think the way we approach brain computation. In particular, we argue for a detailed understanding of neuronal function and network organization is required prior to neuronal network modeling attempt.","","978-1-7281-1419-4","10.1109/ICCICC46617.2019.9146078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146078","","Handheld computers;Cognitive systems","","1","","0","IEEE","22 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional multi-or many-core general CPUs are still popular for easy programming and porting of general applications. However, it is getting to face to the limit by semiconductor technology limit, memory capacity per core, network bandwidth, etc. GPU represents the attached accelerator solution in heterogeneous computing thanks to its high peak performance ratio to power consumption, and moreover, recent progress on AI applications such as TensorFlow ready NVIDIA GPUs. However, GPU's extremely high performance is provided by wide width of data parallel computation both in instruction level and core/thread level which requires thousands of SIMD operations simultaneously executed. Many of success stories on GPU acceleration depend on their simple parallel execution and quite low rate of exception (if statements) handling. Another problem is the interconnection network which relies on CPU-bundle high performance network such as InfiniBand. In our research team has been focusing on the FPGA computation, which is one of the hot topics of new type of accelerators for HPC, however it is quite difficult to achieve a comparable performance with GPU especially for SIMD style applications. So, we think that a new generation of accelerated computing supported by multiple heterogeneous accelerator platform including several types of ones together on computation node. The first target is a combination of GPU and FPGA to provide 360-degree solution with SIMD and pipelined parallelism depending on the characteristics of each computation part of a large application.

This paper analyses and compares some alternative RPN formulation proposed in the literature to overcome these limits. This paper takes into account only the alternative RPN, which proposes a powerful solution without increasing the computational complexity and remaining coherent to the classical idea included in the international standard IEC 60812. In order to compare the advantages and disadvantages of these alternative RPNs, an FMECA was developed for a heating, ventilation, and air condition (HVAC) system in railway application. The critical analysis of the comparison can provide recommendations and suggestions regarding the choice of the alternative RPN based on the type of application. Finally, this paper takes into account the scales reduction of possible values related to the parameters (i.e., occurrence, severity, and detection), which influence the assessment of the RPN. This approach allows the designers to mitigate the drawbacks related to the full scale and provide an easier and faster assessment of the scores to evaluate the criticality analysis and prioritization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2928120","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8759874","FMECA;railway engineering;reliability theory;risk priority number","Dispersion;Sensitivity;Histograms;IEC Standards;Indexes","","33","","66","CCBY","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This area of study is interesting and challenging because there is no simple “one-size-fits all” mapping between a color and the message that color can evoke in a particular person. Nevertheless, many of our daily decisions are influenced by the color palettes being presented to us. In this paper, we propose a novel computational algorithm to create color palettes that convey certain messages. It starts by constructing a weighted graph of color categories and messages that are based on semantic similarities between vector representation of the messages and delta-E color similarities between colors. The color selection process for a given message includes applying a Personalized PageRank algorithm on the graph, treating the message nodes as the personalizing factors. As a result, we have a distribution of probabilities over all the color nodes that have higher probabilities for the nodes neighboring to given messages. Finally, palettes are ranked on the basis of visual aesthetics, novelty, and the conflicting/reinforcing messages they evoke. We have applied this work to several interesting use cases where artists and fashion designers used the resulting color palettes to assist their creation process.","0018-8646","","10.1147/JRD.2019.2893904","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8618305","","Image color analysis;Color;Packaging;Psychology;Companies;Computer architecture;Visualization","","2","","35","IBM","18 Jan 2019","","","IBM","IBM Journals"

The proposed system ensures permanent protection of the biometric data as templates are stored and compared in the encrypted domain.

It offers high value for customers, for example, in the fields of robotics, logistics, and automation, or in context-aware IT services. Especially for autonomous systems, dynamic human-machine interaction, or augmented reality applications, precise localization coupled with a high update rate is a key. In this paper, we present a completely novel localization concept whereby received radio signal phase values that are fed into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) without any preprocessing are evaluated. Standard preprocessing steps, such as angle-of-arrival estimation, beamforming, and time-of-flight or time-difference-of-arrival estimations are not required with this approach. The innovative localization concept benefits from the high sensitivity of radio signals' phase to distance changes and the fast and straightforward recursive computation offered by the EKF. It completely forgoes the computational burden of other phase-based high-precision localization techniques, such as synthetic aperture methods. To verify the proposed method, we use an exemplary setup employing a 24 GHz frequency-modulated continuous-wave (CW) single-input multiple-output secondary radar with 250 MHz bandwidth. A high-precision six-axis robotic arm serves as a 3D positioning reference. The test setup emulates a realistic industrial indoor environment with significant multipath reflections. Despite the challenging conditions and the rather low bandwidth, the results show an outstanding localization 3D RMSE of around 1.7 cm. The proposed method can easily be applied to nearly any type of radio signal with CW carrier and is an attractive alternative to common multilateration and multiangulation localization approaches. We think it is a quantum leap in wireless locating, as it has the potential for precise, simple, and low-cost wireless localization even with standard narrowband communication signals.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2900799","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8648434","FMCW;radar;localization;extended Kalman filter;near field;indoor","Kalman filters;Covariance matrices;Transmitters;Receiving antennas;Radar;Wireless sensor networks;Wireless communication","","32","","28","OAPA","21 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The large number of antennas makes the Maximum-Likelihood (ML) detector infeasible to be implemented due to high complexity, despite its optimal performance. Sphere Decoder (SD) has a bit error rate (BER) performance similar to ML detector, therefore making it more efficient (0.5-1.25 dB gain) than Linear Detectors (LD), proposed in the literature. However, the low complexity of LD and the non-deterministic behavior of SD are the main reasons that prohibit the use of sphere decoding methods in MMIMO systems. The results of this paper disrupt conventional thinking and show that there may be a future for SD in certain MMIMO system. The number of visited nodes during detection and the Initial Radius (IR) method are crucial for the computational complexity of SD. In this paper, an effective IR method, decreasing significantly the complexity and the number of visited nodes is proposed. Furthermore an optimization at tree searching further reduces the number of visited nodes, where in combination with an implementation featured with one-node-per-cycle architecture minimize the latency and make the SD attainable to large-scale systems for $E_{b}/N_{0}\geq 4 \ \mathrm{dB}$.

Rehabilitation is the natural remedy for recovering from paralysis and enhancing the quality of life. Brain Computer Interface (BCI) controlled assistive technology is the new paradigm, providing assistance and rehabilitation for the paralysed. But, most of these devices are error prone and also hard to get continuous control because of the dynamic nature of the brain signals. Moreover, existing devices like exoskeletons brings additional burden on the patient and the caregivers and also results in mental fatigue and frustration. To solve these issues Artificial Muscle Intelligence with Deep Learning (AMIDL) system is proposed in this paper. AMIDL integrates user intentions with artificial muscle movements in an efficient way to improve the performance. Human thoughts captured using Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors are transformed into body movements, by utilising microcontroller and Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) device. EEG signals are subjected to pre-processing, feature extraction and classification, before being passed on to the affected body part. The received EEG signal is correlated with the recorded artificial muscle movements. If the captured EEG signal falls below the desired level, the affected body part will be stimulated by the recorded artificial muscle movements. The system also provides a feature for communicating human intentions as alert message to caregivers, in case of emergency situations. This is achieved by offline training of specific gesture and online gesture recognition algorithm. The recognised gesture is transformed into speech, thus enabling the paralysed to express their feelings to the relatives or friends. Experiments were carried out with the aid of healthy and paralysed subjects. The AMIDL system helped to reduce mental fatigue, miss-operation, frustration and provided continuous control. The thrust of lifting the exoskeleton is also reduced by using light weight wireless electrodes. The proposed system will be a great communication aid for paralysed to express their thoughts and feelings with dear and near ones, thereby enhancing the quality of life.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2941491","The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) EPICS, USA(grant numbers:2016-12); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8839118","Artificial muscle intelligence;assistivetechnologies;BCI;EEG;exoskeleton;healthcare;intelligent solutions;deep learning system;paralyzed;stroke","Electroencephalography;Exoskeletons;Muscles;Robot kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Task analysis","","37","","46","CCBY","16 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Analyzing Tongue Images Using a Conceptual Alignment Deep Autoencoder","Y. Dai; G.

This paper explores how artificial neural networks (ANNs) can learn abstract concepts by analyzing tongue images based on concepts from traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), which is a discipline that relies heavily on practitioner experience. A computer-aided method will be investigated that analyzes sensory data for TCM practitioners. This paper proposes capitalizing on deep learning techniques. A method called the conceptual alignment deep auto-encoder (CADAE) is proposed to analyze tongue images that represent different body constitution (BC) types, which are the underlying concepts in TCM. In the first step, CADAE encodes the images to a representation space; in the second step, it decodes the patterns. The experiments demonstrate that CADAE can learn effective representations of abstract concepts aligned with BC types by encoding the tongue images. Furthermore, the representation space of the hidden conceptual neurons can be visualized by a decoder network. The experiments also demonstrate that ANNs acquire different data perspectives when different loss functions are used for training. Numerous representation spaces of ANNs remain to be explored. To some extent, our exploration demonstrates that artificial intelligence (AI) has the ability to learn some concepts in a manner similarly to human beings. Based on this ability, AI shows promise in helping humans form new effective concepts that can facilitate medical development and alleviate the burdens of medical practitioners.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2788849","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61632009,61472451); Guangdong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017A030308006); High-Level Talents Program of Higher Education in Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2016ZJ01); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8244274","Conceptual alignment deep autoencoder;deep learning;representation learning;tongue image;traditional Chinese medicine","Tongue;Machine learning;Medical diagnostic imaging;IEEE Constitution;Biological system modeling;Neurons","","29","","41","OAPA","1 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The fuzzy min-max (FMM) neural network combines the operations of an artificial neural network and fuzzy set theory into a common framework. FMM is considered one of the most useful neural networks for pattern classification. This paper aims to 1) analyze the FMM neural network in terms of its impact in addressing pattern classification problems; 2) examine models that are proposed based on the original FMM model (i.e., existing FMM-based variants); 3) identify the challenges associated with FMM and its variants, and; 4) discuss future trends and make recommendations for improvement. The review is conducted based on a methodical protocol. Through a rigorous searching and filtering process, the relevant studies are extracted and comprehensively analyzed to adequately address the defined research questions. The findings indicate that FMM plays a critical role in providing solutions to pattern classification issues. The FMM model and a number of FMM-based variants are identified and systematically analyzed with respect to their aims, improvements introduced and results achieved. In addition, FMM and its variants are critically analyzed with respect to their benefits and limitations. This paper shows that the existing FMM-based variants still encounter issues in terms of the learning process (expansion, overlap test, and contraction), which influence the classification performance. Based on the review findings, research opportunities are suggested to propose a new model to enhance the number of existing FMM models, particularly in terms of their learning process by minimizing hyperbox overlap pertaining to different classes as well as avoiding membership ambiguity of the overlapped region. In short, this review provides a comprehensive and critical reference for researchers and practitioners to leverage FMM and its variants for undertaking pattern classification tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2911955","Universiti Malaysia Pahang(grant numbers:RDU180369,PGRS1803110); Baoji University of Arts And Sciences(grant numbers:ZK2018062); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8693724","Fuzzy min–max;pattern classification;neural network;FMM models","Neural networks;Analytical models;Brain modeling;Neurons;Complexity theory;Fuzzy set theory;Task analysis","","18","","65","OAPA","18 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Almost all existing AI personal assistants serve as service terminals to chat with human users for certain tasks. We are instead interested in building AI personal assistants for a different yet important dialog scenario, where they chat with people to fulfill specific tasks on behalf of their human users. As the personal assistants are playing a requester role, instead of a service terminal role, the conversation goal becomes delivering or requesting information according to specific user requests precisely and efficiently. The challenge for the conversation policy is that all user requests must be delivered precisely, while the challenge for the response generation is that it's generally expected for machine generated responses to cover multiple information slots, either requesting or delivering, to make the conversation efficient. In this paper, we present Table-to-Dialogue, a novel approach to address the above challenges when building a requester role AI personal assistant. We employ an encoder-decoder network to learn explicit conversation policy, which generates the corresponding information slots based on the conversation context and the user request table. We further integrate a novel Multi-Slot Constrained Bi-directional Decoder (MS-CBD) into the above encoder-decoder network, to generate machine response according to the multiple slot values and their intermediate representations from the policy decoder. Different from the existing single direction text decoder approaches, MS-CBD leverage the bi-directional context of the response when generating it to enhance the semantic coherence. The experiments shows that our approach significantly outperform the state-of-the-art conversation approaches on automatic and human evaluation metrics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2998432","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61902034); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9104906","Dialogue system;sequence generation;deep learning;constrained decoding;table-to-text;natural language process","Decoding;Bidirectional control;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Buildings;Semantics;Coherence","","7","","36","CCBY","1 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this regard, this paper aims at providing foundations to make the descriptive knowledge that is extracted by pattern mining more user-centric by relying on flexible data structures defined on two different perspectives: concepts and data records. In this sense, items in data can be grouped into abstract terms through subjective hierarchies of concepts, whereas data records can also be organized based on the users' subjective perspective. A series of easy-to-follow toy examples are considered for each of the two perspectives to demonstrate the usefulness and necessity of the proposed foundations in pattern mining. Finally, aiming at experimentally testing whether classical pattern mining algorithms can be adapted to such flexible data structures, the experimental analysis comprises different methodologies, including exhaustive search, random search, and evolutionary approaches. All these approaches are based on well-known and widely recognized techniques to demonstrate the usefulness of the provided foundations for future research works and more efficient and specifically designed algorithms.

However, there is a strong need to develop an accountability and explainability framework for AI in financial services, based on a risk-based assessment of appropriate explainability levels and techniques by use case and domain. This paper proposes a risk management framework for the implementation of AI in banking with consideration of explainability and outlines the implementation requirements to enable AI to achieve positive outcomes for financial institutions and the customers, markets and societies they serve. The work presents the evaluation of three algorithmic approaches (Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Type 2 Fuzzy Logic with evolutionary optimisation) for nine banking use cases. We review the emerging regulatory and industry guidance on ethical and safe adoption of AI from key markets worldwide and compare leading AI explainability techniques. We will show that the Type-2 Fuzzy Logic models deliver very good performance which is comparable to or lagging marginally behind the Neural Network models in terms of accuracy, but outperform all models for explainability, thus they are recommended as a suitable machine learning approach for use cases in financial services from an explainability perspective. This research is important for several reasons: (i) there is limited knowledge and understanding of the potential for Type-2 Fuzzy Logic as a highly adaptable, high performing, explainable AI technique; (ii) there is limited cross discipline understanding between financial services and AI expertise and this work aims to bridge that gap; (iii) regulatory thinking is evolving with limited guidance worldwide and this work aims to support that thinking; (iv) it is important that banks retain customer trust and maintain market stability as adoption of AI increases.","1558-4739","978-1-7281-6932-3","10.1109/FUZZ48607.2020.9177542","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177542","Regulatory Compliance;Accountability and Explainability;Type-2 Fuzzy Logic;Neural Networks","Artificial intelligence;Fuzzy logic;Industries;Ethics;Data models;Uncertainty;Government","","17","","45","IEEE","26 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research on the generation algorithm of adversarial examples is conducive to evaluate the robustness of CNNs and promotes the study of defense algorithm. Although existing attack algorithms have achieved good performance in white-box manner, they behave unsatisfactorily in black-box manner. In this paper, we propose the mini-batch gradient based iterative method which could dramatically improve the attack ability in black-box manner. The previous iterative methods such as Iterative Fast Gradient Sign Method (I-FGSM) always make the generated adversarial examples fall into over-fitting, however we use minibatch gradient information to help them jump out of the local minimum. Moreover, the proposed method can also be considered as self-ensemble or implicit ensemble attack thus have a stronger attack power. The parallel randomization layer plays core role for providing the mini-batch gradient and the implement of it is very simple since there are no trainable variables. In order to further improve the attack success rate, we combined the momentum and the proposed method. We conducted several experiments on seven networks and the highest success rate of black-box attack has reached 94.1%, which is close to the whitebox manner. Since the proposed method greatly improve the transferability of adversarial examples, we think it could help evaluate the robustness of various deep networks.","2573-3311","978-1-7281-4248-7","10.1109/ICACI49185.2020.9177719","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9177719","adversarial example;adversariat attack;mini-batch gradient;parallel randomization;self-ensemble","Iterative methods;Robustness;Neural networks;Training;Data models;Computer vision;Security","","2","","24","IEEE","26 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the calculation cost becomes enormous as the size of the models becomes larger. Various techniques for compressing the size of the models have been proposed to improve performance while reducing computational costs. One of the methods to compress the size of the models is knowledge distillation (KD). Knowledge distillation is a technique for transferring knowledge of deep or ensemble models with many parameters (teacher model) to smaller shallow models (student model). Since the purpose of knowledge distillation is to increase the similarity between the teacher model and the student model, we propose to introduce the concept of metric learning into knowledge distillation to make the student model closer to the teacher model using pairs or triplets of the training samples. In metric learning, the researchers are developing the methods to build a model that can increase the similarity of outputs for similar samples. Metric learning aims at reducing the distance between similar and increasing the distance between dissimilar. The functionality of the metric learning to reduce the differences between similar outputs can be used for the knowledge distillation to reduce the differences between the outputs of the teacher model and the student model. Since the outputs of the teacher model for different objects are usually different, the student model needs to distinguish them. We think that metric learning can clarify the difference between the different outputs, and the performance of the student model could be improved.

One of the biggest challenges in education is the transfer of innovations and new didactic approaches into the school system. To ensure a high standard of teaching, it is essential that the teachers' expertise, pedagogical content knowledge as well as digital competences are continuously improved by further training. In-service training for teachers is offered in different settings (short-, middle- and long term), with advantages and disadvantages. Two aspects that correlate positively are the costs and the sustainable outcome of these trainings. With these aspects in mind the Educational Pyramid Scheme (EPS) is currently being developed and implemented as part of an Erasmus Plus project. It is an innovative concept that aims at spreading new learning contents and methods in a relatively short time within the school system, with low costs and high effect. It is inspired by the economical pyramid scheme, which is designed to create value through the exploitation of business opportunities. The transaction content of the Educational Pyramid Scheme refers to methods or strategies that are being exchanged, and to the resources and capabilities that are required to enable the exchange. According to a train-the-trainer principle, teachers and pupils will be qualified to be trainers, who then spread their knowledge and skills to people in their school and beyond. The EPS contains three different functions or roles: multipliers (teachers and scientists), mentors (teachers) and tutors (pupils). The motivation to participate is maintained with a benefit system adapted for each target group. The training of target groups follows high qualitative standards and therefore presents different phases: input, practical phase and reflection. This paper describes the development of the EPS and its first implementation in the framework of the Austrian mandatory curriculum ""Basic Digital Education"" including computational thinking and programming. It presents some qualitative results gained so far from interviews and observation, which are satisfactory and deliver good arguments for the further implementation of the EPS.","2377-634X","978-1-7281-8961-1","10.1109/FIE44824.2020.9274172","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9274172","teacher training;pyramid scheme;train the trainer;professional development;modeling","Training;Technological innovation;Stakeholders;Pupils;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Organizations","","5","","21","IEEE","4 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The present study explores whether the rich behavioral data collected during ""swarming"" can be used to further increase the accuracy of swarm-based forecasts. To do this, a dense neural network was used to process the data collected during a set of swarm-based forecasts and generate a Conviction Index (CI) for each forecast that estimates its expected accuracy. This method was then tested in an authentic forecasting task – wagering on sporting events against the Vegas odds. Specifically, groups of sports fans, working as real-time swarms, were tasked with predicting the outcome of 238 NBA games over 25 consecutive weeks. As a baseline, the swarms achieved an impressive 25% net return on investment (ROI) against the Vegas Odds. This was compared to an enhanced method that used Conviction Index to (a) estimate the strength of each forecast and then (b) wager only on forecasts of sufficient strength. The CI-selected wagers yielded a 57% net ROI against Vegas Odds. This is a significant gain, equivalent to more than doubling the ROI of the naïve swarm betting strategy.","2472-7555","978-1-5386-8439-9","10.1109/CICN.2019.8902352","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8902352","Swarm Intelligence;Artificial Swarm Intelligence;Collective Intelligence;Human Swarming;Artificial Intelligence;Collaborative Intelligence;Machine Learning;Sports Forecasting;Wisdom of Crowds","","","2","","18","IEEE","18 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many sources believe that such covert channels are intrinsic to highly advanced processor architectures based on speculation and out-of-order execution, suggesting that such security risks can be avoided by staying away from high-end processors. This paper, however, shows that the problem is of wider scope: we present new classes of covert channel attacks which are possible in average-complexity processors with in-order pipelining, as they are mainstream in applications ranging from Internet-of-Things to Autonomous Systems. We present a new approach as a foundation for remedy against covert channels: while all previous attacks were found by clever thinking of human attackers, this paper presents a formal method called Unique Program Execution Checking which detects and locates vulnerabilities to covert channels systematically, including those to covert channels unknown so far.","1558-1101","978-3-9819263-2-3","10.23919/DATE.2019.8715004","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8715004","","Security;Hardware;Microarchitecture;Hazards;Software;Pipelines;Timing","","31","","21","","16 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Research shows remote sensing technology has long been recognized the significance in geological works, which greatly promoted mineral exploration in a cost-effective manner, especially in the Himalayan orogenic belt with poor natural environment. However, several challenges still exist in relation to the limited spectral band and spatial resolution of remote sensing images, as well as the onerous data processing. In this context, this study sought to resolve these two issues by applying a hybrid approach that comprises image fusion, metric learning, and random forest methods. For the first challenge, multisource and multisensor remote sensing data were integrated to provide more comprehensive spatial texture characteristics and spectral information. To address the second challenge, this study used a hybrid method of metric learning and random forest to promote computing efficiency and classification accuracy. This process is illustrated through a case study of lithological mapping in Cuonadong dome, the northern part of the Himalayan orogeny belt. Seven target lithological units were effectively discriminated with an 85.75% overall accuracy.

With the emergence of the cyber-physical system (CPS)-oriented thinking, there has lately been a strong interest in co-design of control algorithms and their implementation platforms. Some recent efforts have shown that a schedule on multiple applications with more on-chip cache reuse is able to improve the control performance. However, it has not been studied how the control performance can be maximized for a given schedule and how an optimal schedule can be computed. In this work, we propose a two-stage framework to compute the schedule maximizing the overall control performance of all the applications. First, a holistic controller design taking all the sampling periods and sensing-to-actuation delays in a schedule into account is presented, aiming to maximize the overall control performance. Second, a hybrid search algorithm for discrete decision space is reported to efficiently compute an optimal schedule.

In this article, we show that the mass use of technology, more specifically social media, have led to the conscious will of users to be hijacked by platforms in order to increase their user-base and capital. We do this by first evaluating the impact of technology on one's conscious will, the feeling that one's actions are caused by oneself. After finding that technology makes users feel as though their actions are more consciously willed, and people naturally want to feel consciously willed, the next logical step is to analyze how modern tech companies use this to their advantage. Looking at features from popular social media, we describe how these features artificially increase the feeling of users' actions being consciously willed, regardless of if the users are actually consciously willing their actions. Finally, we discuss ways in which individuals can reclaim control over their conscious will, and how to reduce this commodification of will at a company level. The ability of a company to control the decision-making metrics of their users should strike one as troubling; whereas the power of a company to hypnotize its users into thinking that they are using the platform because they want to, and not because the company wants them to, is quite concerning.","1937-416X","","10.1109/MTS.2019.2913074","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8733781","","Handheld computers;Cyberspace;Digital systems;Twitter;Facebook;Social networking (online);Decision making;Social implications of technology","","","","23","IEEE","10 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Metaphor identification plays a significant preliminary role in the field of machine translation, reading comprehension, and automatic summarization, making it a focus of natural language processing. Recently, research into Chinese verb metaphor identification has become a widespread concern. The main problem is that the usage of semantic resources is relatively simple, and there is a lack of deep semantic support. Therefore, this paper proposes a word representation method suitable for metaphor classification tasks, which combines the traditional word vector with structural information from the Synonym Thesaurus, so that the word vector can contain the abstraction degree of the word in the metaphor. On this basis, we propose a verb metaphor attention network based on subject-predicate and verb-object relationships, which gives full consideration to the global syntactic information when we perform LSTM encoding and calculate the weight of each word. At the same time, it can facilitate the understanding of literalness and non-literalness. The experimental results show that the identification effect improves on the existing results, indicating that word representation combining semantic resources and attention network can improve the verb metaphor identification performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2932136","NSFC Programs(grant numbers:61602079,61632011); Ministry of Education(grant numbers:16YJCZH141); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8782559","Attention network;metaphor identification;metaphor dataset;semantic representation","Thesauri;Semantics;Task analysis;Deep learning;Computational modeling;Natural language processing","","5","","21","CCBY","31 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Cognitive Dynamic System for Control and Cyber-Attack Detection in Smart Grid","M. I. Oozeer; S.

False data injection (FDI) attacks are a family of new attacks that have been considered to be the most dangerous cyber-attack as it leads to cascaded bad decision making throughout the SG network, which can lead to severe repercussions. The conventional state estimation and bad data detection techniques, which have been applied to reduce observation errors and detect bad data in energy system state estimators, cannot detect FDI attacks. Here, we bring into play an objective-seeking system to act as the supervisor of the SG network. To this end, we propose to introduce a new metric for the SG: the entropic state. The entropic state has two purposes: 1) it provides an indication of the grid's health on a cycle-to-cycle basis and 2) it can be used to detect FDI attacks. Consequently, improving the entropic state is the goal of the supervisor. To achieve that objective, the supervisor dynamically optimizes the state estimation process by reconfiguring the weights of the sensors in the network. With optimality in mind, the CDS is the superior choice for the supervisory system. In this structure, the CDS interacts with the SG network, which is considered as the environment. Computer simulations are carried out on a 4-bus and the IEEE 14-bus systems to highlight the performance of the proposed approach in detecting both bad data and FDI attacks in the SG, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2922410","Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8735819","Bad data detection (BDD);false data injection;cognitive dynamic systems;cognitive control;cumulative sum (CUSUM);cyber-physical attack;cyber-physical systems;online estimation;smart grid;smart grid security","State estimation;Transmission line measurements;Power measurement;Smart grids;Measurement uncertainty;Mathematical model;Voltage measurement","","20","","50","OAPA","12 Jun 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A central controller will play the role of information flow centre and has to afford a lot of computational loads when it needs to manage a large number of trains simultaneously. It is believed that with the development of artificial intelligence algorithms, the control system could be built based on a semi-decentralised multi-agent system (MAS). This paper proposes an innovative MAS system to enhance the decision-making of the rail transit control system. This proposed MAS includes several agents, e.g., train agents, station agents, and a central agent. A train agent can exchange information with other agents directly and make decisions based on the collected data. A case study is carried out to build a preliminary MAS for a rail transit control in Suzhou Metro. Compared with the centralised control system, this MAS can reduce the computational pressure of the central controller and improve the information exchange efficiency. The proposed method is expected to advance the thinking of how to achieve fully automated train control in the future.","","978-1-83953-083-8","10.1049/cp.2018.1732","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8826801","MULTI-AGENT;RAIL TRANSIT;DECISION APPROACH","Medical services;Safety;Artificial intelligence;Rails;Optimization;Rail transportation;Biomedical engineering","","","","","","19 Sep 2019","","","IET","IET Conferences"

These advances are carrying quantum computers closer to their impending commercial utility. Drug discovery is a promising area of application that will find a number of uses for these new machines. As a prominent example, quantum simulation will enable faster and more accurate characterizations of molecular systems than existing quantum chemistry methods. Furthermore, algorithmic developments in quantum machine learning offer interesting alternatives to classical machine learning techniques, which may also be useful for the biochemical efforts involved in early phases of drug discovery. Meanwhile, quantum hardware is scaling up rapidly into a regime where an exact simulation is difficult even using the world’s largest supercomputers. We review how these recent advances can shift the paradigm with which one thinks about drug discovery, focusing on both the promises and caveats associated with each development.

Compared to cloud computing, edge computing has high dynamics, and therefore the resources shall be correspondingly managed in an adaptive way. Traditional model-based resource management approaches are limited in practical application due to the involvement of some assumptions or prerequisites. We think it is desirable to introduce a model-free approach that can fit the network dynamics well without any prior knowledge. To this end, we introduce a model-free DRL approach to efficiently manage the resources at the network edge. Following the design principle of DRL, we design and implement a mobility- aware data processing service migration management agent. The experiments show that our agent can automatically learn the user mobility pattern and accordingly control the service migration among the edge servers to minimize the operational cost at runtime.

But even in light of breakthrough results on recent benchmarks, it is still fair to ask if our recognition algorithms are doing as well as we think they are. The vision sciences at large make use of a very different evaluation regime known as Visual Psychophysics to study visual perception. Psychophysics is the quantitative examination of the relationships between controlled stimuli and the behavioral responses they elicit in experimental test subjects. Instead of using summary statistics to gauge performance, psychophysics directs us to construct item-response curves made up of individual stimulus responses to find perceptual thresholds, thus allowing one to identify the exact point at which a subject can no longer reliably recognize the stimulus class. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation framework for visual recognition models that is underpinned by this methodology. Over millions of procedurally rendered 3D scenes and 2D images, we compare the performance of well-known convolutional neural networks. Our results bring into question recent claims of human-like performance, and provide a path forward for correcting newly surfaced algorithmic deficiencies.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2018.2849989","Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity(grant numbers:#D16PC00002); NSF(grant numbers:DGE #1313583); NSF SBIR(grant numbers:#IIP-1621689); Nvidia; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8395028","Object recognition;visual psychophysics;neuroscience;psychology;evaluation;deep learning","Visualization;Computer vision;Computational modeling;Psychology;Task analysis;Machine learning;Observers","","42","","46","IEEE","25 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Similarly, the role of the Internet of Things (IoT) and vehicular computing has emerged due to smart cities. This is further complemented by edge and fog computing architectures. The emerging concept of vehicular fog computing has enabled the platform to support delay-sensitive applications and to reduce the workload on the backend networks. Vehicular fog computing is a paradigm that touches the boundaries of thinking vehicles as an infrastructures-as-a-service. The use of vehicles to provide computation on-the-move poses various challenges. The vehicles with onboard computing equipment can facilitate delay-sensitive applications. These vehicles can act as an edge device to reduce the load from a backbone network. However, due to continuous mobility, it is difficult to use traditional frameworks to distribute the computation task among vehicles. In this paper, we propose a framework termed vFog. The vFog is designed to provide computing facilities from nearby fog vehicles. The framework utilizes the onboard computing facility of vehicles without the support of roadside units (RSUs). Moreover, the proposed framework handles churn behavior and supports multi-hop communication to improve the task delivery ratio.

The steadily growing complexity of a modern SoC challenges hardware computer architects on how best to do early stage ideation. Late SoC design typically relies on detailed full-system simulation once the hardware is specified and accelerator software is written or ported. However, early-stage SoC design must often select accelerators before a single line of software is written. To help frame SoC thinking and guide early stage mobile SoC design, in this paper we contribute the Gables model that refines and retargets the Roofline model---designed originally for the performance and bandwidth limits of a multicore chip---to model each accelerator on a SoC, to apportion work concurrently among different accelerators (justified by our usecase analysis), and calculate a SoC performance upper bound.

It can be difficult to determine the structurally interesting parts of interaction data, though, like what set of button clicks constitutes an action that matters. In the case of visual analytics systems that use machine learning models, there is a convenient marker of when the user has significantly altered the state of the system via interaction: when the model is updated based on new information.

Generally, we think most of samples that are well-clustered or away from the true decision boundary can be easily interpreted by an interpretable model. Removing those samples can help to learn a more accurate black-box model by focusing on the left samples around the true decision boundary. Inspired by this, we propose a data re-weighting based framework to align an interpretable model and a black-box model, letting them focus on the samples what they are good at, hence, achieving both interpretation and accuracy. We implement our IB-M framework for a real medical problem of ultrasound thyroid nodule diagnosis.

We think one key point is that humans have background knowledge, which is essential for topic understanding. Inspired by this, we propose a knowledge base enhanced topic model in this paper. We take knowledge bases as good presentations of human knowledge, with huge collections of entities and their relations. We assume that documents with related entities tend to have similar topic distributions. Based on this assumption, we compute document similarity information via the linked entities and then use it as a constraint for LDA. More specifically, we embed entities in a low-dimensional space via DeepWalk and use Entity Movers Distance to efficiently and effectively measure the similarities between documents. The results of experiments over two real-world datasets show that our method boosts the LDA model on the document classification while no supervision information is needed.","","978-1-7281-8156-1","10.1109/ICBK50248.2020.00061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9194489","Topic Model;LDA;Knowledge Base","Knowledge based systems;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Semantics;Optimization;Resource management;Transforms","","2","","27","IEEE","11 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are currently no accurate feasibility or Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) studies to encourage them to go for the Cloud approach and stop modernizing CDC. Since Cloud cost is one of the key topics nowadays, a one-year project was conducted to modernize and innovate a Classical Data Center (CDC) owned by a Jordanian information technology company and track the associated expenses to determine whether modernization of a CDC or adoption of Cloud computing instances is more cost-effective. To achieve clear insights, this study presented the cost difference between modernization of CDC and Oracle Cloud adoption. The results of this research study revealed that Cloud Computing is highly cost effective when TCO is calculated.

To tackle this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism named “attention to Time-Dependent Pre-Attention” (TDPA-attention) and the TDPA-attention is combined with a hierarchical LSTM decoder to compose our captioning model (TDPA-model). Within our TDPA-attention, at every time step, every image feature pays attention to all image features according to a semantic context and the attended feature is treated as an aggregated feature that contains relations between this image feature and all image features. All these aggregated features form a new feature set that the hierarchical LSTM decoder attends to. We evaluate our model on public image caption dataset Microsoft COCO and achieve state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics.","1051-4651","978-1-5386-3788-3","10.1109/ICPR.2018.8545355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8545355","","Decoding;Task analysis;Semantics;Visualization;Feature extraction;Computational modeling;Computer science","","1","","19","IEEE","29 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a generic theoretical model that can be used to analyze systems that are comprised of multiple sub-domains - each sequentially consistent.

Interactions with a standardized patient may teach healthcare professional students how to diagnose a clinical condition, better manage a patient, or help them improve their bedside manners, but such simulated interactions will not prepare the learners to deal with unpredictability of clinical situations, interruption, and task switching. Distractions occur from colleagues, clinical decision support alerts, pagers, smartphones, or audible alarms. All these interruptions can potentially alter the course of patient care and the outcome of a patient's treatment. A simulated virtual patient (VP) may teach critical thinking skills, but once a student has successfully diagnosed a VP, the simulation stops providing educational value. In this paper we propose a generalizable method for integrating agent-based models into serious games and simulations. In the proposed paradigm, a human player (learner) takes on the role of a single agent in the model (e.g, a healthcare professional), while the output of the model controls the environment, the rules of agent interactions, and all the other agents that the human player interacts with (non-player characters). Moreover, we will present two use cases demonstrating that the use of agent-based models as behavior controllers for non-player characters introduces a degree of unpredictability in a virtual patient simulation and in a serious game designed to teach middle and high-school students about the spread of infectious diseases.","2573-3060","978-1-7281-9042-6","10.1109/SeGAH49190.2020.9201889","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9201889","virtual patients;simulations;serious games;non-player characters;agent-based models","Games;Medical services;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Computational modeling;Switches;Biological neural networks","","1","","64","IEEE","22 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these optimization problems, the human preferences and thinking constrain achieving the optimal value of the problem objective(s). If there is a single objective, then the optimization problems are called single objective optimization problems (SOOPs) else the multi-objective optimization problems (MOOPs). Various solution methodologies have been proposed for SOOPs and MOOPs, which are useful, as long as the SOOPs and MOOPs involve the numeric data. However, the data is generally in linguistic form (or words), when elicited by the human beings. Therefore, the SOOPs and MOOPs are referred as single objective linguistic optimization problems (SOLOPs) and multiobjective linguistic optimization problems (MOLOPs), respectively, in such situations, to emphasize the existence of linguistic information in optimization problems. In these LOPs, the value of the objective function(s) may not be known at all points of the decision space, and therefore, the objective function(s) as well as problem constraints are linked through if- then rules. Previously, the Tsukamoto's inference method was used to solve these types of LOPs; however, it suffers from drawbacks. As, the use of linguistic information inevitably calls for the utilization of computing with words (CWW), hence, in this paper, we discuss the solution methodologies for LOPs based on the perceptual reasoning (PR). PR is a novel CWW engine design for the CWW approach of perceptual computing. We also demonstrate the applicability of PR based solution methodology for LOPs to the case study of car purchase modelled as LOP.","1558-4739","978-1-5386-1728-1","10.1109/FUZZ-IEEE.2019.8858854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8858854","Computing with words;Interval type 2 fuzzy sets;Linguistic optimization problems;Perceptual reasoning.","Linguistics;Optimization;Linear programming;Firing;Cognition;Computational modeling;Fuzzy sets","","","","30","IEEE","11 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The organizational memory will be organized into networks of memory agents related through concepts of semantic proximities or semantic generalizations. The concepts of proximity, specialization and generalization can be precisely defined using qualifications related to the acquaintances of the agents. The chapter finally shows that the general psyche of an artificial system, when it is distributed over multiple corporeal systems with local artificial consciousnesses, can be unified.","","9781119551010","10.1002/9781119550983.ch2","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823129.pdf&bkn=9820819&pdfType=chapter","","Software agents;Computational modeling;Organizations;Regulators;Task analysis;Context modeling;Computer science","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Uncertainty [2] in reliability prediction for complex electronic systems/equipment is mainly originated from the incomplete considerations on the specified environmental conditions and on the impacts to the equipment. This paper focuses on the incomplete considerations on the space radiation environment (SR see Acronyms in table 1) and their impacts on complex electronic equipment in satellites, airplanes, and ground network computers working daily in SR. Based on Risk Informed Decision Making (RIDM) analysis framework [3], this paper proposes an accurate reliability prediction method to accommodate SR and SR impacts on complex electronic equipment to avoid uncertainties originated from the incomplete considerations on SR theoretically more complete or accurate than the traditional methods, such as FIDES [4], MIL-HDBK-217 [5], etc, which has not considered SR. This paper is creative on the following 3 novel points. (1) SR reliability concept: For accurate reliability prediction, this paper proposes an SR reliability concept based on RIDM framework. The concept accommodates SR and SR impacts critical to mission success by the SR reliability definition and the RIDM 5 steps analysis method to have a close loop systematic thinking on incomplete considerations on SR. (2) SR reliability model: For an accurate reliability prediction based on the SR reliability concept, this paper proposes a new SR reliability model focused on the SR impact rate for complex electronic equipment, connecting the incomplete considerations of SR with mission success in a close loop by 1) The relationship [6] between Reliability and SR impact rate, 2) The relationship [6] between SR impact rate and TID, DD, and SEE impact rate, 3) The relationship between SEE impact rate and SEE effect rate. (3) SR reliability prediction application and verification: This paper provides 3 case studies on satellite, avionics, and ground network computer applications. Additionally, the SR impact rate for avionics of a satellite navigation receiver prototype is predicted and compared with the test results [7] with good agreement. Case studies show that for safety critical applications, the SR impact rate is significant and not negligible. And the SR reliability concept and model is practical and useful for displaying possible key contributions to SR mitigation strategies or Defense-in-depth systematically for mission success.This paper gives an example for the accurate reliability prediction based on RIDM, focusing only on accommodating SR. However, as a general systematic method, it can be applied in broader areas on more SR and non-SR stresses.","2577-0993","978-1-7281-3690-5","10.1109/RAMS48030.2020.9153596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9153596","RIDM;SR reliability model;SR impact rate;Single event Effect","Reliability;Computer network reliability;Circuit faults;Built-in self-test;Space radiation;Satellites;Computational modeling","","","","23","IEEE","31 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Businesses all over the world invest heavily to stay secure in the cyberspace and rely on security experts in defending their business from online threats. The immense scale of the internet and the dynamicity of the threat it holds forces the adoption of automated threat detection systems. Several cybersecurity use cases exist, but the two use cases discussed here are DGA detection and Malicious URL detection. This paper addresses the drawbacks of previous rulebased and machine learning based detection methods. Here, embedding concepts from NLP is incorporated into cybersecurity use cases to propose a new in house model christened S.P.O.O.F Net, which is a combination of a Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory Network. The proposed model is benchmarked with machine learning algorithm incorporating bi-gram feature engineering techniques and also a conventional CNN with character level embedding (same as the one used for S.P.O.O.F Net). It was observed that S.P.O.O.F Net gave better performance over the aforementioned methods with accuracy scores of 98.3% for DGA detections and 99% for malicious URL detection. This work also aims to demonstrate the possibilities of incorporating NLP concepts to cybersecurity use cases and provide future researches a new thinking curve to develop systems in this domain.","","978-1-5386-8276-0","10.1109/SPW.2018.00041","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8424657","convolutional neural network;long short term memory;domain generation algorithms;malicious url detection;natural language processing","Uniform resource locators;Machine learning;Logic gates;Computer crime;Botnet;Logistics","","19","3","16","IEEE","6 Aug 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to improving FPGA performance, toolchains for the development of FPGAs in OpenCL have been developed and offered by FPGA vendors that reduce the programming effort required. These improvements reveal the possibility of implementing a concept to enable on-the-fly offloading computation at which CPUs/GPUs perform poorly to FPGAs while performing low-latency data movement. We think that this concept is key to improving the performance of heterogeneous supercomputers using accelerators such as the GPU. In this paper, we propose an OpenCL-enabled data movement method to directly access the global memory of the GPU and show how to implement cooperative GPU-FPGA computation using it. The results of experiments show that our proposed method can achieve a latency of 0.59 μs and a data transfer rate as high as 7.0 GB/s between the GPU and the FPGA, thus confirming that it is effective at realizing high-performance cooperative GPU-FPGA computation.","","978-1-7281-3510-6","10.1109/IPDPSW.2019.00090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8778224","GPU, FPGA, OpenCL, BSP, PCIe, DMA, I/O channels, Verilog HDL, Heterogeneous platform, Accelerator computing, Interconnect for accelerators","Field programmable gate arrays;Kernel;Hardware design languages;Ethernet;Graphics processing units;Hardware;Programming","","13","","14","IEEE","29 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Requirements We Live By","B. Nuseibeh","School of Computing & Communications, The Open University, Milton Keynes, UK",2019 IEEE 27th International Requirements Engineering Conference (RE),"5 Dec 2019","2019","","","1","1","Enlightened requirements engineering (RE) researchers and practitioners generally accept that RE is as much about understanding the world as it is about understanding the software and systems that will be built to inhabit that world. As a result, the RE field has fostered a multi-disciplinary following of researchers and practitioners who are prepared to engage deeply in application domains, to apply a range of technical and socio-technical skills to understand those domains, and to accept that the outcome of an effective RE process may not deliver a software system at all. The RE community has also developed, deployed, and evaluated a wide range of contributions that reflect such enlightenment: conceptual models that reflect the relationships between the world and the machine, domain models and scenarios that reflect understandings of problem domains, and enterprise models that reflect the organisations and processes that build and deploy systems. All these in addition to the models that capture the all-important behaviour of systems and software. It seems to me however that the RE discipline is at a crossroads. The mechanics of the discipline appear to be established - much of the published research is now empirical - or technical, but only in so far as it responds to technological advances elsewhere, such as mobile and ubiquitous technologies represented by the Internet of Things, richer application domains such as Industrie 4.0 and Smart Cities, or more advanced computational techniques that are maturing, such AI, machine learning, and blockchains. As a community, we reassure ourselves that our discipline is safe and thriving, after all RE is a “forever problem”: all systems we wish to build will have requirements, now and forever. But this is to be complacent. RE has no protected status to study and deploy requirements. The formal models we elicit, design, and build are increasingly deployable by other disciplines, as are the values that we seek our modern, AI-driven systems to embody. A new and potentially radical re-framing of our discipline may be needed, and I will speculate what this may look like. It may require letting go of what we have considered to be the boundaries of our discipline, while embracing new but fluid boundaries. I have advocated and explored “software without boundaries” as one such framing that challenges the separation of `world and the machine', not because I don't accept the separation of the `what' and the `how', the `indicative' and the `optative', or the `problem' and the `solution', but because the world we live in no longer accepts these separations. Society, more often than not, does not think of systems, of technology, or indeed of software; it thinks of ways of working, ways of interacting, ways of living. Requirements, such as they are, are `requirements we live by' not requirements of systems in the world. At an extreme, if one believes the AI hype, `the world and the machine' will increasingly be replaced by the `world in the machine'. Where does the RE community stand on this, and what can this community do to contribute to the framing and solving of this new reality? My own work in recent years has evolved to reflect the above. I still revisit, with some pride, the `RE Roadmap' that Steve Easterbrook and I published in 2000 - many of the fundamental RE principles we presented still hold today. But I cringe at how we missed the changing nature of the world in which we operate: a world populated by autonomous and adaptive systems, populated by big data and associated analytics, and populated by stakeholders whose multiple perspectives reflect a multitude of ethical and social values, not all of which are wholesome, and many of which are actively subversive or malicious. My own research on security and privacy requirements only scratches the surface of this evolving reality. I invite the RE community to reflect on how it frames its own research in this context.","2332-6441","978-1-7281-3912-8","10.1109/RE.2019.00009","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8920530","requirements-engineering;software-engineering,;security-and-privacy","Requirements engineering;Conferences","","","","0","IEEE","5 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"CHIUW 2020 Keynote Arkouda: Chapel-Powered, Interactive Supercomputing for Data Science","W. Reus",U.S. Department of Defense,2020 IEEE International Parallel and Distributed Processing Symposium Workshops (IPDPSW),"28 Jul 2020","2020","","","650","650","Data science and high-performance computing (HPC) should be a great match: with datasets growing well beyond the memory of a single node and computations becoming ever more communication-intensive, the need for HPC in data science seems clear. And yet, there remains a frustrating gap between the two disciplines. One major reason is that data science is an interactive sport-data scientists overwhelmingly gravitate towards interactive platforms (e.g., Jupyter notebooks) and interpreted languages (e.g., Python)-whereas the culture of HPC tends to eschew interactivity in favor of compiled programs and batch jobs. While HPC practitioners prize computational efficiency, data scientists live by the very different maxim of rapid hypothesis testing and have demonstrated that they are willing to ignore HPC technologies entirely rather than give up interactivity. Bridging this gap entails a change in thinking about the purpose of an HPC and how it should be used. This talk motivates and demonstrates the interactive use of up to hundreds of HPC nodes in data science workflows with an open-source package called Arkouda, which exposes massively parallel, distributed NumPy-like arrays to a Jupyter notebook running Python 3. We have chosen the NumPy format and Jupyter and Python as front-end technologies in order to conform to interfaces familiar to data scientists. Because Arkouda arrays can be constructed from and exported to NumPy arrays, users can perform heavy computations on hundreds of HPC nodes and bring back small sets of results for rich introspection in a single-node Python environment. In the future, we plan to use this interoperability as a template for bringing existing HPC codes into an interactive framework, much as NumPy has brought optimized C and Fortran routines into interactive Python workflows. Meanwhile, the computational heart of Arkouda is a relatively compact yet highly scalable Chapel interpreter that implements a powerful set of data science primitives. Functionally, this interpreter comprises a dispatcher, modular data transformations, and a zero-copy, in-memory object store, all implemented in about 12,000 lines of Chapel. While these components and design principles appear in other open-source projects, the competitive advantage of Arkouda comes from the unique position Chapel holds as a productive language with performance and scaling on par with industry-standard HPC technologies. For this reason, Arkouda is small enough to be maintainable while achieving good scaling on communication-intensive primitives (e.g., argsort) up to at least 512 nodes of a Cray XC.","","978-1-7281-7445-7","10.1109/IPDPSW50202.2020.00109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9150382","","Distributed processing;Conferences","","7","","0","IEEE","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, given the growing number of students interested in computational tools and resources for research automation, relying on student self-teaching and learning is not an efficient method for training the next generation of scholars. To address the educational need for computational thinking and learning across various academic departments on campus, the UC San Diego Library has been running Software Carpentry workshops (two day bootcamps to introduce foundational programming concepts and best practices) since 2015. The Library, as a discipline-agnostic entity with a history of serving as a trusted resource for information, has been well positioned to provide training for this new era of research methodology. The core of our success is the collaboration with the growing community of Software and Data Carpentry instructors at UC San Diego with expertise in various research disciplines.

These courses frame the world around computation, and show learners that they can think about problems they see in everyday life in the context of computation. Our paper shows an analysis of repeat learners (learners who enroll in the same course multiple times) and their behaviors over the many runs of these courses. Around 20% of learners in any given run of a course are repeat learners. Of these, the majority are two-time repeat learners (learners who took the same course exactly twice). We show that learners tend to perform better when they retake a course, and especially when they retake the course sooner rather than later. We also look at a subgroup of learners we call repeat cross-referencers (learner who accessed at least two previous runs of the course during the run time of a later run of the course). We found that repeat cross-referencers complete the course at a suspiciously high rate, and we speculate it is because they are looking back at answers from a previous course run. Lastly, we look at how learners perform in an introductory class and an advanced class. We found that many learners who take both courses are more likely to complete both courses and have more active days in the courses than those learners who only do one of the two classes.","","978-1-7281-9728-9","10.1109/LWMOOCS50143.2020.9234342","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9234342","computation;programming;learners;cheating;MOOC","","","2","","7","IEEE","26 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Throughout this paper a modular and adaptive course is presented, the main objective of which is to make known simple and economic tools of educational robotics. This course is aimed at those who want to discover the possibilities of educational robotics in the context of the introduction to robotics. Today, robotics training tools are raised with the aim of promoting innovation and motivation of students during the learning process. Robots are becoming more and more common in our daily lives; therefore, it is important to integrate robots into all levels of our society. The course is designed to work with the Scratch, Crumble and Arduino tools as STEM enhancers. Using Scratch, interactive stories, games and animations can be programmed. Scratch helps young people to acquire and improve skills such as think creatively, think systematically, and work collaboratively. Scratch is a project of MIT Media Lab's Lifelong Kindergarten Group. It is offered free of charge. On the other hand, Crumble is an easy-to-use programmable controller. Its programming interface uses a block programming language based on Scratch that makes it easy for children from 10 years old to use it. In addition, the hardware elements associated with Crumble are very intuitive and easy to connect. Last, but not least, Arduino is an open source electronic platform based on hardware and software that is easy to use. It is a platform that incorporates a simple microcontroller and an interface development environment to create the applications to be downloaded on the board. The course offers a three-tiered journey through three levels with each of the three tools. It consists of a total of 9 modules. This course has a very practical approach. A project-based pedagogical methodology is used. Experiments are promoted, where trial and error are part of learning and self-discovery. The student learns to have more autonomy and responsibility. Knowledge is acquired in different disciplines. It develops: motor skills (scale mobility in the hands), group skills, allowing people to socialize, creative abilities, and learning in a fun way. The operational details, materials used and examples of activities for some modules are also presented with the expectation that all teachers will be able to adapt these activities in their class. In addition, results are included from several groups of students who have already completed some modules. Despite not having a large number of students, the experience provided results that may be useful for other teachers to promote a course with similar or equal content for more results. The results of this work show that it is important to combine theory and practice to include fun tasks intertwined with the challenges of applying theory to problem solving.","2377-634X","978-1-5386-1174-6","10.1109/FIE.2018.8658513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8658513","education;programming;robotics;STEM","Tools;STEM;Programming profession;Service robots","","23","","25","IEEE","7 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Arduino board is an embedded platform that focus on enabling an easy way to teach embedded systems, but, due to its success, it ended up being used in different teaching levels, ranging from primary to university. The board was also applied in the teaching of robotics and other contexts since it is relatively cheap, easy to program and its community has produced a considerable amount of free educational material. Even though Arduino is a success it is still maturing in terms of educational purposes, aside the electronic knowledge that needs to be explored, the board is programmed, by default, with c++, which is considered not friendly to Computer Thinking beginners. Trying to solve this problem, many solutions apply Visual Programming, which is proven to make it easy for unexperienced and even children to learn the basis of Computational Thinking, in the educational context with Arduino. Even though there are many solutions applying visual programming for Arduino, there are no systematic review or survey on this subject, meaning that it is hard to identify where are the gaps and which are the problems that are already solved. Therefore, on this paper, it was performed a systematic review on the subject, the method found 372 papers, which 31 were selected for full review. The reviewed solutions where discussed and categorized, we expect that the presented results could be used as guideline for new research in the area and by educators and companies that are looking for visual programming tools for the Arduino board.","2643-685X","978-0-7381-1153-7","10.1109/LARS/SBR/WRE51543.2020.9307023","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9307023","Arduino;Visual Programming Tools;Systematic Review;Survey","Tools;Programming profession;Visualization;Education;Protocols;Visual databases;Systematics","","1","","44","IEEE","7 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Apparently, that is why there is a full-fledged career in data entry. Data entry method varies with requirements. Early days of computers relied on punch cards and gradually keyboards and mouse came into picture which we still use. Touchscreens didn't take much time to replace the physical keyboard inputs and now as the result of human intelligence and innovation, the era of the optical input is here. Where the user does not even have to take the pain of thinking about entering data but can simply use an optical reader or scanner to input data. Using the computational power the individual elements like text, images, and special characters can be distinguished. OCR-Optical Character Recognizer does the work. OCR works similar to humans when it comes to character recognition as it maintains a database of characters and compares all the scanned elements with the database which makes it really simple to understand. This paper explains the working of an OCR in its different stages. That study helps in finding the various drawbacks of the conventional system. The paper also tells about how those shortcomings can be eliminated and how a better OCR that is future ready can be achieved.","","978-1-5386-2842-3","10.1109/ICCONS.2018.8663011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8663011","OCR;document analysis;Processing;OCR system;document","Optical character recognition software;Character recognition;Text analysis;Databases;Conferences;Control systems;Technological innovation","","8","","12","IEEE","10 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the second learning scenario, pupils were introduced to two educational robots used as a learning tool - Thymio and Codey Rocky. The aim of the second activity was linking the programming concept to a real-world scenario. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected using pre- and post- questionnaires. The pre-questionnaires contained questions about the pupils' background knowledge, i.e. basic concepts of programming and robotics. The post-questionnaires were designed to evaluate the workshops impact on the pupils' perception of these observed concepts and their overall satisfaction with the workshops.

It would therefore be natural to think that the use of deep learning methods on SITS would lead to advances comparable to those known in the field of computer vision. However, when applied to concrete cases, the results are not as convincing. This paper proposes a comparison between a SOTAG (Spatial-Object Temporal Adjacency Graphs) SVM based spatio-temporal classification approach and the Recurrent Neuronal Network (RNN), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model which is trained by historical SITS. The trained LSTM networks are then used to predict new time series data. Both methods perform a spatio-temporal map indicating the temporal profiles of cartographic regions. The proposed approaches will be applied on real and simulated SITS data.

Everybody has a sense of trusting people or institutions, but how is trust defined? The definition of trust always depends on the specific field of research and application, which makes it hard to answer this question in general at a computational level. Thinking of knowledge processing systems we face this question twice. How can we define and calculate trust values for the input data and, more challenging, what is the trust value of the output? Within this paper we consider a binary, a probabilistic, an opinion-space and - our recently developed approach - a weighted arithmetic mean trust model. Then we show ways, how knowledge processing systems can handle these trust values and propagate them through a network of processing steps in a way that the final results are representative. With these presented and developed models, we can give insights to the topic of defining and propagating trust in knowledge processing systems.","2324-9013","978-1-5386-4388-4","10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00212","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8456081","Trust;Propagation;Knowledge Processing Systems;Trust Metrics;Trust Models;Precision","Probabilistic logic;Knowledge engineering;Semantic Web;Cognition;Uncertainty;Conferences;Measurement","","1","","10","IEEE","6 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This urgency becomes indeed crucial when targeting transfer learning in remote sensing, as understanding the actual relationship between diverse sensors is fundamental to accurately characterize the considered scenes. In this work, we derive a reliability metric by means of an information theory-based approach. The proposed metric is able to estimate how confident one can be of the considered datasets when characterizing each pixel in the considered region of interest.

Without adopting a fully deterministic perspective, it is nevertheless a fact that if the user interface is screen-based and graphical and the input modality is mouse-based, then it is likely that the form of that interaction—that is, what the turn-taking looks like and what is demanded by the user—is very similar to other screen-based interfaces with similar input devices. However, the design space for the form of interaction is growing quickly. While command-based interfaces and text-based interfaces defined almost the whole design space in the 1970s, developments since then, including novel ways of bringing sensors, actuators, and smart materials to the user interface, have certainly opened up a broader design space for interaction design.","","9780262344692","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8333151.pdf&bkn=8327686&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","12 Apr 2018","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

While computers seem to be accessible everywhere, particularly outside school, where children and youth are connecting to wider networks of other young users, their capacity to wield such devices critically, creatively, and selectively is decidedly less potent. Learning the language of computers introduces students to processes for thinking and solving problems and for engaging creatively and critically with digital media. Using the example of electronic textiles—computational artifacts in which circuits are stitched with conductive thread to connect microcontrollers and control sensors and actuators, I describe how we can broaden access, diversify representation, and deepen learning. More importantly, I illustrate how the introduction of crafting with computing in schools that serve marginalized populations can help diversify who makes and the kinds of artifacts that are being made, how projects can introduce more complex programming concepts and practices, and what kind of tools we can design to support novice programmers in coding and debugging hybrid artifacts.","1943-6106","978-1-7281-0810-0","10.1109/VLHCC.2019.8818860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8818860","","Smart textiles;Programming profession;Media;Debugging;Yarn;Visualization;Statistics","","","","","IEEE","19 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is not the name of a branch of mathematics such as number theory, algebra, calculus. This is a separate branch of knowledge, which is called “discrete” (individual). However, there are also processes of continuous mathematics, that is, it becomes a continuous whole. Discrete data can only take integer values, while continuous data can take any value. Discrete mathematics was created several decades ago and is the mathematical language of computer science. Scientists have found that the mathematical disciplines taught in universities are insufficient for learning a programming language. Therefore, they combine additional maths topics into one course, now called discrete mathematics. Discrete mathematics is the foundation of computer science and theoretical computer science. Without learning discrete mathematics, we miss the essence of the logic of computer science. Due to the multiplicity of objects within discrete mathematics, rational clarity in solving programming issues is possible. Every field in computer science is associated with discrete objects, be it databases, network components, computer organization, compilers, network programming, and so on. Essentially, discrete mathematics studies the concepts of counting, mathematical structures, logic, recursion, computational modeling, graph theory and algorithms, and many other disciplines. Evidence, a basic concept in discrete mathematics that includes deductive thinking, simplification, pattern identification, mathematical notation, working within constraints and conditions. This does not mean that a formal course in discrete mathematics is necessary or should be required for programmers. However, many of the concepts discussed in discrete mathematics are applied using this science. In this article, we will look at the basic postulates of discrete mathematics that are necessary to learn the basics of programming.","","978-1-7281-9969-6","10.1109/ICISCT50599.2020.9351412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351412","discrete mathematics;programming;computer engineering;informatics;modeling;algorithms;determinants","Training;Information science;Program processors;Organizations;Mathematics;Trajectory;Programming profession","","","","10","IEEE","19 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In third world countries, the situation is much more unbalanced. Poor educational and economic conditions, allied with a chauvinism culture contaminated by sexism and stereotypes, are strong forces that repel the young girls from IT areas. As a result, the percentage of women in local Computer Science majors is lower than expected.

In this paper, we delve into the widely-used metric Inception Score (based on KL divergence), revealing that it fails to detect intra-class mode collapse. Meanwhile, Wasserstein distance has received much attention in comparing distributions in recent years but suffers heavy computational burden in high dimensional space. Our idea is that we can find specific embedding space where Euclidean distance could mimic Wasserstein distance to solve the heavy computational problem. This space can be found using a Siamese network, which could be trained quickly because of shared weights. We also apply several proposed new techniques to get better image embedding. To evaluate our proposed metric (Siamese Score), we simulate mode collapse using K-means clustering performed on real data set. To further validate it, we perform an empirical study on several GAN models and use the generated images to do the task. Experiments show that Siamese Score can detect mode collapse and is time-efficient compared with Inception Score and we think our score can be complementary to Inception Score.","","978-1-7281-4852-6","10.1109/CISP-BMEI48845.2019.8965997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8965997","","","","","","36","IEEE","23 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The deployed applications have significant dependency on the infrastructure available with the application providers. Bounded by the limitations of available resource pools on-premises, many application development companies have migrated the applications to third party cloud environments called data centers. The data center owners or the cloud service providers are entitled to ensure high performance and high availability of the applications and at the same time the desired scalability for the applications. Also, the cloud service providers are also challenging in terms of cost reduction and energy consumption reductions for better manageability of the data center without degrading the performance of the deployed applications. It is to be noted that the performance of the application does not only depend on the responsiveness of the applications rather also must be measured in terms of service level agreements. The violation of the service level agreements or SLA can easily disprove the purpose of application deployments on cloud-based data centers. Thus, the data center owners apply multiple load balancing strategies for maintaining the desired outcomes from the application owners at the minimized cost of data center maintainability. Hence, the demand of the research is to thoroughly study and identify the scopes for improvements in the parallel research outcomes. As the number of applications ranging from small data-centric applications coming with the demand of frequent updates with higher computational capabilities to the big data-centric application as big data analytics applications coming with efficient algorithms for data and computation load managements, the data center owners are forced to think for efficient algorithms for load managements. The algorithms presented by various research attempts have engrossed on application specific demands for load balancing using virtual machine migrations and the solution as the proposed algorithms have become application problem specific. Henceforth, the further demand of the research is a guideline for selecting the appropriate load balancing algorithm via virtual machine migration for characteristics-based specific applications. Hence, this paper presents a comprehensive survey on existing virtual machine migration and selection processes to understand the specific application-oriented capabilities of these strategies with the advantages and bottlenecks. Also, with the understanding of the existing measures for load balancing, it is also important to furnish the further improvement strategies, which can be made possible with a detailed understanding of the parallel research outcomes. Henceforth, this paper also equips the study with guidelines for improvements and for further study. Nonetheless, the study cannot be completed without the mathematical analysis for better understanding and experimental analysis on different standards of datasets for better conclusive decisions. Hence, this paper also presents the discussion on mathematical models and experimental result analysis for the conclusive decision on the improvement factors and the usability of the migration methods for various purposes. Finally, this paper is a comprehensive survey on the background of the research, recent research outcomes using mathematical modeling and experimental studies on various available datasets, and finally identify the scopes of improvements considering various aspects such as execution time, mean time before a VM migration, mean time before a host shutdown, number of node shutdowns, SLA performance degradation, VM migrations, and energy consumption.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8762113","Data center;load balancing;task scheduler;FIFO;FAIR;capacity;hybrid;LATE;SAMR;context-aware;threshold;IQR;LR;MAD;LRR;THR;VM consolidation;VM migration;MC;MMT;RS;MU;PlanetLab;metric;VM migration analysis;energy consumption analysis;SLA analysis","Task analysis;Load management;Cloud computing;Data centers;Resource management;Virtual machining;Indexes","","30","","74","CCBY","15 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we focus on programming the industrial robot for assembly tasks by parsing the human demonstration into a series of assembly skills and compiling the skill to the robot executables. To achieve this goal, an identification system using multimodal information to recognize the assembly skill, called MASD, is proposed including: 1) an initial learning stage using a hierarchical model to recognize the action by considering the features from action-object effect, gesture, and trajectory and 2) a retrospective thinking stage using a segmentation method to cut the continuous demonstrations into multiple assembly skills optimally. Using MASD, the demonstration of assembly tasks can be explained with high accuracy in real time, driving a hypothesis that a PBD system on the top of MASD can be extended to more realistic assembly tasks beyond pure positional moving and picking. In experiments, the skill identification module is used to recognize the five kinds of assembly skills in demonstrations of both single and multiple assembly skills, and outperforms the comparative action identification methods. Besides integrated with the MASD, the PBD system can generate the program based on the demonstration and successfully enable an ABB industrial robotic arm simulator to assemble a flashlight and a switch, verifying the initial hypothesis. Note to Practitioners-In the conventional robotized automation, the key role of the robot mainly owes to its capacity for repeating a wide variety of tasks with high speed and accuracy in long term, with a cost of days to months of programming for deployment. On the other hand, the new trend of customization brings the new characteristics: production in short cycle and small volume. This irreversible momentum urges the robot to switch from task to task efficiently. The biggest bottleneck here is the tedious programming, which also has high prerequisites for most practitioners in manufacturing. This situation motivates the development of a PBD system that can understand the assembly skills performed by the human experts in the demonstration and accordingly generate the program for robot's execution of the taught task. In this paper, we present a skill decoding system to parse the observational raw demonstration into symbolic sequences, which is the crucial bridge to enable the automatic programming. The system achieves high performance in recognition and is tailored for the PBD in assembly tasks by considering both advantages and disadvantages in the background of assembly, such as controllable environment and limited computational resources. It is particularly useful for assembly tasks with modularized actions based on a set of standard parts. At the perspective of industrial application, the PBD upon the proposed system is a promising solution to improve the flexibility of manufacture, which is expected to be true in midterm but an important step toward this goal.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2017.2783342","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U1609210,61473258); Science Fund for Creative Research Groups(grant numbers:61621002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8263146","Activity recognition;robot learning;robot programming","Service robots;Activity recognition;Robot learning;Robot programming;Real-time systems","","32","","49","IEEE","18 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The modular multiplication operation, which is one of the most computationally demanding operations in the fundamental arithmetics, takes up a large part of the computations in the protocol. In this paper, we propose an improved unconventional-radix finite-field multiplication (IFFM) algorithm which reduces the computational complexity by about 20% compared to previous algorithms. We then devise a new high-speed modular multiplier architecture based on the IFFM. It is shown that the proposed architecture can be extensively pipelined to achieve a very high clock speed due to its complete feedforward scheme, which demonstrates significant advantages over conventional designs. The FPGA implementation results show the proposed multiplier has about 67 times faster throughput than the state-of-the-art designs and more than 12 times better area efficiency than previous works. Therefore, we think that these achievements will greatly contribute to the practicability of this protocol.","2374-7390","978-1-7281-1927-4","10.1109/SiPS47522.2019.9020384","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9020384","Modular multiplication;supersingular isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) key exchange;post-quantum cryptography (PQC);hardware architecture;FPGA","Complexity theory;Computer architecture;Field programmable gate arrays;Hardware;Protocols;Cryptography;Adders","","9","","17","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It has been proposed that this disorder is related to disrupted brain connectivity, which has been verified by many studies. With the development of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), further exploration of brain connectivity was made possible. Region-based networks are commonly used for mapping brain connectivity. However, they fail to illustrate the connectivity within regions of interest (ROIs) and lose precise location information. Voxel-based networks provide higher precision, but are difficult to construct and interpret due to the high dimensionality of the data. In this paper, we adopt a novel high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model – $\psi$-learning method, which can help ease computational burden and provide more accurate inference for the underlying networks. This method has been proven to be an equivalent measure of the partial correlation coefficient and, thus, is flexible for network comparison through statistical tests. The fMRI data we used were collected by the mind clinical imaging consortium using an auditory task in which there are 92 SZ patients and 116 healthy controls. We compared the networks at three different scales by using global measurements, community structure, and edge-wise comparisons within the networks. Our results reveal, at the highest voxel resolution, sets of distinct aberrant patterns for the SZ patients, and more precise local structures are provided within ROIs for further investigation.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2018.2854659","National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:R01GM109068,R01MH104680,R01MH107354,P20GM103472,2R01EB005846,1R01EB006841); National Science Foundation(grant numbers:#1539067); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8408706","Schizophrenia (SZ);brain connectivity;fMRI;Gaussian graphical models (GGMs);network comparison","Correlation;Covariance matrices;Learning systems;Biomedical measurement;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Informatics;Graphical models","Adult;Algorithms;Brain;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;Nerve Net;Schizophrenia;Young Adult","9","","38","IEEE","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Then, on the basis of users' current and historical interest, we calculate their combined user similarity. Next, we present a novel two-hop-algorithm to update users' friend community. Considering the preferences of the whole friend community, the Computational Thinking (CT) skills of users and the impact factors of items, we put forward a recommendation function to obtain items that are related to users.

The research objective is to build a framework for developing IoT skills within higher education to establish the computing competencies needed for this rapidly expanding technology. The investigation included the most widely used programming language for IoT, Python, and the Maths skills at the HE level, which are essential for developing successful infrastructure, functionality, security algorithms and encryption tools for IoT. Quantitative research methodology is applied on empirical data obtained on non-Computer Science students (Non-CS) in a HE institution in UAE. There is a correlation between in university (InUni) Maths skills and Python programming course's performance. Compared to Engineering students, Business students may found it more challenging to learn Python programming language, which also applies to their Maths skills. This suggests better IoT competencies developed by Engineering students. The paper concluded that N on-CS students are able to obtain sufficient knowledge of, and skills in, using Python within one semester. The future study should consider other factors, such as general knowledge, business awareness, technology applications and legal issues.","","978-1-7281-5061-1","10.1109/ITT48889.2019.9075075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9075075","Internet of Things;IoT;Python;programming;coding;scripting;Engineering;Business;Maths Skills","Python;Business;Programming profession;Engineering students;Internet of Things","","4","","19","IEEE","23 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, while teaching evolutionary programming to students of Computer Science, we decided to equip them with the technical details and then let them explore the creative aspects themselves. As part of the introductory course on Artificial Intelligence, an evolutionary generation of art is an assignment The teaching goals were to inform students of creative aspects of EA as well as invoke critical thinking and analysis in them. The students generated images via EA, and the only restriction was on the pixel size for input. The assignment was well-received, despite its complexity. Students engaged with the art generation and felt confident in expressing their perspectives of creativity and art The assignment evaluation as a contest allowed for judges from diverse domains such as Computer scientists and artists. The goals of the course are met as the students were trained not only in technical details but also realized the capacity and generative power of algorithms, as they practically simulated and expressed their creative thoughts via this contest Furthermore, the students engaged with the philosophical foundations of computational creativity effectively by the design process, and a report completed along with the work required them to develop their own artistic exegesis of the algorithm.","","978-1-7281-6929-3","10.1109/CEC48606.2020.9185658","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9185658","Art;Contest;Genetic Algorithms;Education","Art;Education;Evolutionary computation;Learning (artificial intelligence);Programming;Mathematics;Creativity","","3","","18","IEEE","3 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its core Big Data arises from historical records from a variety of heterogeneous sources, some aspects are pre-digitized and machine readable. A huge data set (over 4 million records in each source) and its slow manual enrichment (ca 7,000 records processed so far) pose issues of quality, scalability, and creates the need for a quality assurance technology that is accessible to non-programmers. An important goal for the researcher community is to produce a reusable, high-level quality assurance tool for the ingested data that is domain specific (historic data), highly portable across data sources, thus independent of storage technology.This paper outlines the step-wise design of the finer granular digital format, aimed for storage and digital archiving, and the design and test of two generations of the techniques, used in the first two data ingestion and cleaning phases.The first small scale phase was exploratory, based on metadata enrichment transcription to Excel, and conducted in parallel with the design of the final digital format and the discovery of all the domain-specific rules and constraints for the syntax and semantic validity of individual entries. Excel embedded quality checks or database-specific techniques are not adequate due to the technology independence requirement. This first phase produced a Java parser with an embedded data cleaning and evaluation classifier, continuously improved and refined as insights grew. The next, larger scale phase uses a bespoke Historian Web Application that embeds the Java validator from the parser, as well as a new Boolean classifier for valid and complete data assurance built using a Model-Driven Development technique that we also describe. This solution enforces property constraints directly at data capture time, removing the need for additional parsing and cleaning stages. The new classifier is built in an easy to use graphical technology, and the ADD-Lib tool it uses is a modern low-code development environment that auto-generates code in a large number of programming languages. It thus meets the technology independence requirement and historians are now able to produce new classifiers themselves without being able to program. We aim to infuse the project with computational and archival thinking in order to produce a robust data set that is FAIR compliant (Free Accessible Inter-operable and Re-useable).","","978-1-7281-6251-5","10.1109/BigData50022.2020.9378148","Irish Research Council; Science Foundation Ireland; Irish Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9378148","Data Collection;Data Analytics;Model-Driven Development;Historical Data;Data Parsing;Data Cleaning;Ethics;Data Assurance;Data Quality","Java;Quality assurance;Semantics;Big Data;Tools;Syntactics;Cleaning","","2","","34","IEEE","19 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The semantic web lies at the intersection of web and machine understandable meaningful data, turning it into intelligent ‘web of data’. The key requirement with any intelligent system has been to find a concrete knowledge representation that can make the inferences within time and space constraints; that is, reasoning effectively and efficiently within the resource constraints posed to the problem at one hand and with insufficient data as well as incomplete knowledge on the other hand. Various Knowledge representation schemes have been proposed in the literature, each having its limitation over the others. Ontology is the key component for semantic web engineering. Ontologies are conceptual knowledge bases providing a systematic and taxonomical description of the concepts and instances under consideration. Conceptual clarity in the computational representation of a concept is vital for holistic thinking and knowledge engineering. In order to meet the needs of an application/enterprise, knowledge should be presented taking care of all possible perspectives; and represented in a hierarchical structure with differing levels of granularity. This paper discusses about bringing all the manifestations of an ontological concept/decision under one umbrella; hence describing the resultant scheme as a unit of knowledge. By representing a concept as a knowledge unit, classical ontology is claimed to be sufficient in dealing with imprecise, vague and heterogeneous knowledge for real-world web applications; and portrays the capability to acquire fresh knowledge through its thorough interaction with the external world in a given working environment.","1544-5976","","10.13052/jwe1540-9589.1783","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10247277","Semantic Web;Ontology;Unit of Knowledge;Knowledge Representation scheme","Knowledge engineering;Semantic Web;Systematics;Knowledge acquisition;Knowledge based systems;Semantics;Redundancy","","","","38","","22 Sep 2023","","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

US is oldest but with the cult of computer science, data science (machine learning, deep learning) and chip level advancement in the ultrasound devices. This Ultrasound is all set to upgrade and change according to the advancement in evolving technology, information technology with significant challenges and opportunities. High inter- and intra-operator inconsistency and limited image quality management are the few trending issues which are prime focus of the researchers in present days. As mentioned earlier the US devices due to cult introduction of the computer science and data science has become smaller, enhanced computational capability, and become very advanced. Ultrasound also can contribute significantly to decrease changeability with its advanced image processing. However, reading ultrasound imaging is little tricky, in a proposal to make it little supportive to the clinicians and to reduce the load of doctors, many ultrasound computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems with different segmentation, classifiers techniques have been launched. In recent years, the success of data science especially deep learning in the image classification and segmentation is very successful. This led to more and more scholars and researchers to think unanimously realizing that improvement in accuracy, Specificity, and sensitivity of the disease finding can be brought by utilizing the deep learning in the ultrasound CAD system.

Fog computing can thus improve the quality of service of delay-sensitive applications by allowing such applications to take advantage of the low latency provided by fog computing rather than the high latency of the cloud. Therefore, tasks in various IoT applications must be effectively distributed over the fog nodes to improve the quality of service, specifically the task response time. In this paper, two nature-inspired meta-heuristic schedulers, namely ant colony optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO), are used to propose two different scheduling algorithms to effectively load balance IoT tasks over the fog nodes under communication cost and response time considerations. The experimental results of the proposed algorithms are compared with those of the round robin (RR) algorithm. The evaluations show that the proposed ACO-based scheduler achieves an improvement in the response times of IoT applications compared to the proposed PSO-based and RR algorithms and effectively load balances the fog nodes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2975741","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9006805","Fog computing;Internet of Things;quality of service;task offloading and scheduling","Task analysis;Cloud computing;Edge computing;Time factors;Quality of service;Delays;Computer architecture","","154","","42","CCBY","21 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

TC intensity estimation is a challenge because it requires domain knowledge to manually extract TC cloud structure features and form various sets of parameters obtained from satellites. In this paper, a novel hybrid model is proposed based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for TC intensity estimation with satellite remote sensing. According to the intensity of TCs, we divide them into three types and use three different models for intensity regression, respectively. The results show that the use of piecewise thinking can improve the model's fitting speed on small samples. A classification network is provided to classify unlabeled TC samples before TC regression, whose results would determine which regression network to estimate these samples. Finally, the estimation values are sent to the backpropagation (BP) neural network to fit the suitable intensity values.

This attempt means matching equipment and resources with people and their behavior. Therefore, accurate location information is crucial for equipment connecting to CIoT. This endeavor sets a higher requirement for the localization technology of wireless sensor networks in terms of accuracy, energy, and efficiency compared with that in the past. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate mobile anchor node assisted localization algorithm for WSNs based on diameter-varying spiral line (LDVSL), which broadcasts coordinates of the anchor node to assist localizing unknown sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm has two main innovations. First, we obtain the mobile anchor node position through a time and angle mechanism instead of GPS, given the unique characteristics of the diameter-varying spiral line. Second, the linear fitting method is adapted to select the key virtual node, which has the real maximum received signal strength indicator. Simulations indicate that the proposed LDVSL algorithm outperforms other similar algorithms in terms of average localization error and positionable node ratio. The simulations also show that the LDVSL is not affected by obstacles seriously and has good robustness. The LDVSL has a wide prospect of application in CIoT.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901745","Jilin University(grant numbers:SXGJQY2017-9,2017TD-19); Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Department(grant numbers:20150101050JC); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61371092,61401175,61771219); Jilin Agricultural University(grant numbers:2015045); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8653296","CIoT;localization;mobile anchor node;diameter-varying spiral line;linear fitting","Spirals;Path planning;Directional antennas;Wireless sensor networks;Global Positioning System;Internet of Things;Received signal strength indicator","","8","","39","OAPA","26 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Billions of posts, likes, and connections are created by people all around the world every day. The promises of such social media data are plentiful, including understanding “what the world thinks” about a social issue, brand, product, celebrity, or other entity, as well as enabling better decision-making in a variety of fields including public policy, transportation, healthcare, and economics. However, while the validity of these data-driven researches are largely dependent on the accuracy and representativeness of the used data, online social media data collected with common mechanisms are usually biased compared with the distribution of related features in the physical world. For example, sampling issues, especially selection bias, associated with such data sources can have far reaching implications for data analysis and interpretation. Therefore, how to calibrate biases in the online social media data set to achieve unbiased results becomes a significant and urgent problem. In this paper, we propose to address the bias calibration issue by adopting a data resampling approach. Specifically, we develop a data resampling algorithm based on the stochastic stability theory of Markov Chains to collect data samples from the given biased data set to calibrate possible biases. By regarding the data resampling process as status transitions of a stochastic variable, the algorithm leverages the stationary distribution of Markov Chains to build an acceptance matrix to control the resampling process, and thus optimize the original dataset towards target distributions in the physical world. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively output data sets with similar distributions to the target ones.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2966790","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61960206008); Innovative Talents Promotion Program of Shaanxi Province(grant numbers:2018KJXX-011); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:3102019AX10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8960343","Bias correction;data bias;data resampling;social media","Twitter;Sociology;Statistics;Markov processes;Data collection","","6","","41","CCBY","15 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the potential to transform business processes, lower IT expenses, and offer access to unlimited computing resources with minimal management effort, organizations look to cloud-based solutions to achieve business efficiencies. Thus, it would seem that these organizations could easily migrate to CC. However, enterprises are still concerned about moving their business-critical applications to the cloud. Among the reasons are that it is an emerging technology that has not reached a level of maturity; the lack of industry-specific conformity to standards; and a high level of security risks. As a result, there is a big dispute among organizations on the decision of whether it is more business-efficient to embark on the cloud or remain with their interior IT infrastructures. In this paper, we aim to solve this debate by proposing a novel approach that supports decision-making on CC adoption in organizations. Unlike traditional decision-making approaches that pay little or no consideration to organizational high-level business objectives, our proposed approach is driven by the business objectives of the organization. First, we identify driving and restraining forces that influence CC adoption in organizations. Second, a formal decision-making model is proposed based on Force Field Analysis (FFA) augmented by pairwise comparison and Delphi methods, this model estimates the values of the driving and restraining forces based on their impacts on the organization's objectives. By analyzing the forces for and against CC adoption, organizations can decide whether or not to move forward with the adoption. Alternatively, organizations can use the analysis to think about how they can strengthen the forces that support the adoption and weaken the forces opposing it, so that the adoption is more successful. The proposed model is validated for usability and applicability through a use case scenario.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2954415","King Saud University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8906122","Cloud computing;decision making;force field analysis (FFA);pairwise comparison;Delphi method","Organizations;Cloud computing;Standards organizations;Decision making;Force;Software","","5","","56","CCBY","19 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Wi-Fi received signal strength (RSS) fingerprinting provides a promising solution to localize an object in indoor environments. Among the factors challenging the RSS fingerprinting based algorithms are the site survey cost and the time-varying environment, given the unreliable signal qualities. Here we present a novel approach to indoor object positioning using the manifold assumption on the radio map in RSS-location space. Thinking the measured RSS from one access point (AP) in different locations are randomly drawn from a nonlinear manifold (ground truth), we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) style algorithm to reconstruct the sparse representation of this manifold from the noisy RSS observations. Motivated by the observation that the radio map has a strong local correlation in the RSS-location space, we introduce a multi-scale constrained quadratic programming to approximate the manifold. Within limited iterations, we can estimate the ground truth RSS values and parameters simultaneously. As a result, the learned manifold is exploited to predict the object's position: we develop a positioning algorithm by minimizing the manifold distortion effort which integrates both measurement error and manifold shape preservation. We conducted extensive simulations and experiments in different settings, testing the datasets collected in a building in the last 8 months. The results showed that the proposed approach was adaptive to the varying environmental noise levels, presenting robust positioning performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2940629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8830475","Expectation-maximization;indoor positioning;manifold learning;received signal strength","Manifolds;Wireless fidelity;IP networks;Noise measurement;Robustness;Antenna measurements;Position measurement","","5","","35","CCBY","10 Sep 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A motor imagery-based BCI enables patients to control artificial peripherals and communicate with the outside world by merely thinking of the task such as, e.g., the imagination of left-hand, right-hand, or foot movement. The mere intention of moving one of the limbs triggers neural activity, which is induced in the primary sensorimotor areas like that observed with real executed movements. Tracking generated sensorimotor rhythms (SMRs) and extracting robust and informative features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are challenging due to the time-varying nature of EEG signals and the inter-human variability. In this paper, we proposed an EEG-zeros-time windowing (E2ZTW) approach based on a highly decaying window function to track SMRs and identify the temporal epochs containing useful information without any prior information on the trigger. The proposed approach involves the application of the group-delay function, allowing the improvement of the spectral resolution due to the additive property of the function on individual resonances. Some algorithms were integrated into the proposed approach, such as the common spatial pattern algorithm, which is used to extract features and linear discriminant analysis and a convolutional neural network, which are used for the classification of the features. The effectiveness of the proposed approach in tracking the SMRs rhythms is evaluated in terms of accuracy. Experiments were performed on three public datasets provided by BCI competition for 17 subjects. Following experimental results, it is shown that discrimination between the left- and right-hand movements can be achieved within a few seconds with high classification accuracy. As compared to other state-of-art techniques, the proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy and standard error values of 82% and 13, respectively, thereby outperforming existing algorithm by an accuracy mean of 2%.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3017888","Deanship of Scientific Research, King Saud University through the Research Group(grant numbers:RG-1440-109); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9171234","Brain-computer interface (BCI);electroencephalography (EEG);motor imagery;EEG-zero-time windowing;group-delay function","Electroencephalography;Microsoft Windows;Feature extraction;Brain;Training;Task analysis;Tracking","","4","","35","CCBY","19 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, the theoretical analysis of the FSO link effects that are modeled with K-distribution and Negative exponential distributions are considered on the estimation performance of the adaptive incremental networks. These distributions arise when the FSO link is contaminated with strong optical turbulence. Experiments are designed to cover these conditions and the analysis is based on the steady state mean square deviation (MSD) and excess mean square error (EMSE) values for the incremental LMS (ILMS) algorithm and these are the metrics that show how well the adaptive network performs. Simulation results are presented for different parameters of K -distribution and negative exponential distribution and the results show perfect match with the theoretical outcomes.

This is due to the dissimilarities between their physical and psychological limitations. The purpose of this study is to investigate users' white-space ratio preferences for news web pages. We tested the top ten online Chinese and English websites, 20 news web pages in total. Two statements were picked from the system usability scale (SUS) and the visual aesthetics of website inventory (VisAWI) to evaluate these samples. We took these two statements as questionnaire questions. They are the following: Q1 “I think that I would like to use this system frequently” and Q2 “Everything goes together on these web pages.” The design of the questionnaire was based on a five-point Likert scale. The research variables include age, gender, education, occupation, white-space ratio, along with the other demographic properties. Our results indicated that there are significant differences between age, white-space ratio, education, occupation, news sources, computer usage time, and computer usage history. The group aged between 31-45 years old scored all samples higher than other groups. None prefer too high (90%) or too low (50%) white-space ratio.

By using a small number of reliable samples and data close to the boundaries of classification, we propose building a query quality estimator by establishing a relationship between the benefits of good retrieval performance and features of the normalized query commitment that influence query quality. In our proposed transduction model, all queries available are filtered by the proposed query quality estimator and only high quality queries that enhance the effectiveness of retrieval such that they yield performance-related benefits, are used to generate pseudo-labels for learning to rank. Queries that can degrade performance benefits are discarded while creating the pseudo-labels. Pseudo-labels aggregated by high quality queries in transductive learning are then leveraged in learning to rank scenarios without sufficient training data.

Two over-simplified well-known problems, namely, the Traveling Salesman Problem and the Tower of Hanoi problem are presented to demonstrate the point. Both synthetic problems are effectively adapted to solve a real world project. To realize the postulate in a viable architectural construct, data flow and molecular computers are investigated since they show potential computation power.
