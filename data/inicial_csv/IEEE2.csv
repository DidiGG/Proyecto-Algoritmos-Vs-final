In Fall 2012, we deployed creative exercises designed to engage Epstein's creative competencies (Surrounding, Capturing, Challenging and Broadening) in introductory level CS courses targeting four different groups (CS, engineering, combined CS/physical sciences, and humanities majors). Students combined hands-on problem solving with guided analysis and reflection to connect their creative activities to CS topics such as conditionals and arrays and to real-world CS applications. Evaluation results (approximately 150 students) found that creative thinking exercise completion had a linear “dosage” effect. As students completed more exercises [0/1 – 4], they increased their long-term retention [a computational thinking test], F(3, 98) = 4.76, p =.004, partial Eta2 = .127 and course grades, F(3, 109) = 4.32, p =.006, partial Eta2 = .106.

However, these environments lack specific support for teaching computational thinking to novices. Typically, such skills are acquired in ad hoc practical sessions with supervision provided by teachers or peers. The usual scenario is where a teacher guides the students in solving these problems during a game design session. In informal learning settings, step-by-step tutorials for creating existing games are used to compensate for the lack of computer support for solving design and computational problems. In this paper we suggest a game design process that combines support for computational thinking with tool usage, by identifying the most common computational thinking problems and providing a generic solution to them. We have evaluated our solution in the context of AgentWeb, an online cloud-based game design environment for novices.

The integral role that Computational Thinking modalities play in engineering disciplines can serve as an accurate indicator of the student future academic success. Therefore, this study investigated the students' performance in a Computational Thinking course offered at the freshman level to predict student academic success. To achieve this goal, a two-year study of the correlation between the students' accumulative grade point averages and their grades obtained in this course was conducted. The performance of nine hundred and eighty two students in forty sections was assessed over the two-year period. It was concluded that the students' future academic performance is strongly correlated to their Computational Thinking skills assessed at the freshman level. This clearly suggests the viability of using Computational Thinking skills as a fairly accurate predictor of students' academic success.

The Delphi technique was employed to collect different views and derive consensus from a panel of thirteen experts, including computer scientists, computer science educators, K-12 computer teachers, and industry experts. The first draft of Delphi survey questionnaire, consisting of nine themes (problem solving, problem decomposition, algorithms, data representation, data analysis, modeling and simulation, abstraction, automation, and others) and 60 competence indicators, was developed based on our investigation of the nature of computational thinking. After three rounds of survey and a final round-table discussion, the expert panel derived 49 essential competence indicators (13 for grades K to 6, nine for grades 7 to 9 and 27 of grades 10 to 12) and eight optional competence indicators (one for grades 7 to 9 and seven for grades 10 to 12). According to the results, the core ability and training of computational thinking are different in grades. In grades K to 6, students develop logical thinking and problem solving skills in personal and family life. In grades 7 to 9, students must understand the basic concepts of programming and write basic programs. Finally, in grades 10 to 12, they will use high-level skills to apply the concepts of abstraction, modeling, and structured problem decomposition to solve problems in different fields. The results serve as useful references for developing Taiwan's new K-12 computing curriculum.","","978-1-4799-9967-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2015.44","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7126261","Computing Curriculum;K-12 education;Computational Thinking;Delphi Survey","Computational modeling;Analytical models;Data models;Computers;Education;Computer science;Standards","","11","","4","IEEE","18 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We compared this CCE implementation semester (80 students, 95% completing 3 or 4 CCEs) to the Fall 2013 semester of the same course (55 students) without CCEs. CCE implementation students had significantly higher scores on a CS concepts and skills knowledge test (F(1, 132) = 7.72, p < 01, partial Eta2 = .055; M=7.47 to M=6.13; 13 items) and significantly higher self-efficacy for applying CS knowledge in their field (F(1, 153) = 12.22, p < .01, partial Eta2 = .074; M=70.64 to M=61.47; 100-point scale). CCE implementation students had significantly higher study time (t(1, 136) = 2.08, p = .04; M=3.88 to M=3.29; 7-point scale) and significantly lower lack of regulation, which measures difficulties with studying (t(1, 136) = 2.82, p = .006; M=2.80 to M=3.21; 5-point scale).

To be innovative it is necessary that a person use sophisticated cognitive structures to reason over abstractions and deal with hypothesis. These are the characteristics of the formal operational thinking [2]. Therefore, this paper is about the use of formal thinking on computational thinking activities over a digital fabrication project developed in a Brazilian makerspace (POALab FabLab).

For many students the subject of computer science concerns software code but writing code can be challenging, due to specific requirements on syntax and spelling with new ways of thinking required. Not only do many undergraduate students lack these ways of thinking, but there is a general misrepresentation of computing in education. Were computing taught as a more serious subject like science and mathematics, public understanding of the complexities of computer systems would increase, enabling those not directly involved with IT make better informed decisions and avoid incidents such as over budget and underperforming systems. We present our exploration into teaching a variety of computing skills, most significantly ""computational thinking"", to secondary-school age children through three very different engagements. First, we discuss Print craft, in which participants learn about computer-aided design and additive manufacturing by designing and building a miniature world from scratch using the popular open-world game Mine craft and 3D printers. Second, we look at how students can get a new perspective on familiar technology with a workshop using App Inventor, a graphical Android programming environment.

Further, students' spatial abilities are an important prerequisite to technological literacy within virtual environments. In this paper, we explore the challenges and opportunities teaching a large group of first-year, interdisciplinary students to apply spatial thinking skills by undertaking a team-based, design project using an industrial-strength computational design environment (SolidWorks). We describe key instructional principles and techniques used to minimize the complexity of this computational tool, thus enabling students to focus on the tasks and reasoning requirements of the design project. While encouraged by the high degree of students' motivation for building functioning animated mechanical toys (AMTs), students frequently reported being “lost” in SolidWorks (SW) during the modeling phases of the project. Our techniques for scaffolding learning activities have continued to evolve to minimize the challenges faced by novice users of SW and to better support them in developing their spatial thinking skills. We also present our experiences, lessons learned, and ideas for improving the design of the project, and learning activities, such as worked examples of an AMT model, to further reduce the cognitive load and to enable students to focus on visual-spatial reasoning rather than on the tacit skills associated with using SolidWorks.","","978-1-4673-0840-3","10.1109/IEDEC.2012.6186914","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6186914","Spatial thinking;first-year students;3D modeling;computational design software;SolidWorks;small group projects;instructional principles;scaffolding techniques;cognitive load","Assembly;Tutorials;Software;Three dimensional displays;Education;Computational modeling","","","","32","IEEE","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This integrated STEM experience helped a team of researchers that included students from K-12, undergraduate students, graduate students and faculty to collaboratively understand, design and test potential solutions to the problem. The team employed an engineering based Design-Thinking framework combined with effective brainstorming strategies that have been well-established in business, marketing and commercial environments along with a computational mathematics problem solving approach. Not only this integrated STEM experience provided an opportunity for the team of researchers to develop professionally but also gave them an opportunity to become change agents to transform institutional practices and to engage the broader community to inspire the next generation STEM workforce. Specifically, the project framework guided the research team to propose potential integrated STEM based solutions including the application of drones to track illegal poaching as well as the development of an intelligent sensor based tracking system which are validated via sophisticated mathematical and probabilistic algorithms. This overall experience has clearly helped to establish STEM education partnerships and alliances outside traditional boundaries and has helped to create new synergies for all stakeholders who are invested in solving the problem of poaching. Specifically, it has helped to develop an international research experience for high school, undergraduate and graduate students who now have a unique perspective on solving real-world problems in developing countries.

In this context, we explore the use of self-organizing maps for analyzing games produced in a game building workshop offered simultaneously to technical education students in Brazil and to undergraduate students in Computer Engineering in Chile. Metrics from seven CT features present in the games were extracted with the Dr. Scratch tool and used as an input in the training process. The results allowed a clustering analysis considering the identified features and the correlation between learning behaviors. The organization of the map reflected a progressive skill acquisition identified by features present in the developed games.

The base idea is to use games to help create awareness and generated needed CT skills and abilities; in short, it is “games for CT” approach. This is however, one part of the equation for understanding and developing CT in our modern digital age. The other part of the equation lies in using “CT for games”. This paper addresses this perspective to aid in the understanding and framing of the elusive CT concept. In “CT for games”, this paper highlights and draws attention to using CT for developing games instead of using games to develop CT. The core contributions of the paper are a “CT for games” proposed framework; selected variants of health games and observations of “Rebel Design”.

Students in introductory CS courses completed CCEs as part of those courses. Students in Study 1 came from a variety of programs, and students in Study 2 were engineering majors. A profiling approach was used to test whether the impact of the CCEs could be accounted for by differences in students' motivated and self-regulated engagement. Overall, CCEs had positive impacts on students' grades and knowledge test scores, and although there were differences in achievement across the profiles, the impact of the CCEs was generally consistent across profiles.

CT is a must for today’s and tomorrow’s talent. The added-value of this early exposure to CT is that it will help juniors to shape a solid basis of algorithmic and data structures, which form the basic nuts and bolts of the mechanics of computer programming. The added value of developing professionals has its clear impact on the economy perspective, in light of the forecasted demand for today and tomorrow. (World economic forum, 2017) Computer programming is an outstanding way to develop computational thinking skills. It has been taken programming as a useful way for juniors to learn problem solving and computational thinking with an affirmative and quantifiable effect on juniors’ achievement, not only in areas such as math and science, but also in language skills, creativity, interpersonal skills and social emotional interaction.","","978-1-5386-3794-4","10.1109/ICCTA43079.2017.9497195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9497195","","Programming profession;Buildings;Information and communication technology;Shape;Qualifications;Problem-solving;Government","","","","","IEEE","30 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The approach can also be engineered to produce computable programs from conceptual and abstract algorithms as an inverse function. In this paper, we introduce the core idea behind the MindReader online assessment system that is able to understand a wide variety of elementary algorithms students learn in their entry level programming classes such as Java, C++ and Python.

In designing and implementing university curricula, one has to take an increasing number of arguments into consideration. Technological progress requires the design, creation, and analysis of increasingly large and complex systems. Engineering working environments and tasks demand interdisciplinary teams and close communication between involved groups. In designing engineering curricula, these factors need to be considered and the necessary skills must be implicitly or explicitly developed. This paper highlights three examples of classes and projects aimed at enabling students to develop and increase Computational Thinking through systematic introduction of computational tools. From these successful case studies, the paper derives six best practices for fostering Computational Thinking in engineering education. A review of several examples is given, that are used to highlight and extract best practices.

In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.","","978-1-5090-6595-0","10.1109/IWSC.2017.7880506","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880506","","Cloning;Software;Sprites (computer);Programming profession;Parallel processing;Visualization","","29","","23","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers.

The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico. In the hybrid model, we combine the two original models to generate plots for stories of the same sort that MEXICA generates, but using GENCAD's process model to do so. To confirm that the generated plots make sense, the hybrid model integrates commonsense knowledge into its evaluation module.","2375-9259","978-1-4799-4274-9","10.1109/ICDMW.2014.178","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7022619","Commonsense knowledge;computational creativity;plot analysis and generation","Computational modeling;Hybrid power systems;Sociology;Analytical models;Statistics;Computers;Genetics","","","","20","IEEE","29 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent basic studies reveal that AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the adoption of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from the deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by a cognitive systems.

The adoption of the notion of Computing within the basic education schools is a concern in many countries, where the implementation occurs in a strict way. Admittedly, it grows the idea that the Computing discipline is very distinct from the computer classes and that the use of skills from Computing possesses educational (reflection and problem solving, the comprehension that the world is ingrained with the digital technology) and economic (high demand of professionals with good training) benefits. This article, through the vast bibliographic review, describes an international landscape of countries of all Americas, in order to contextualize the reader in respect to the adoption of Computational Thinking within the basic education schools.","","978-1-5090-4596-9","10.1109/SIIE.2016.7751839","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7751839","Computational Thinking;Basic Education;Computing at Schools","Computers;Training;Problem-solving;Economics;Electronic mail;Companies","","34","","25","IEEE","24 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems.

Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044224","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044224","computational thinking;digital literacy;education;programming;Scratch","Educational institutions;Programming profession;Training;Games;Computers","","3","","22","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Akili","Principal, Geotechnical Engineering, Iowa, USA",2015 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE),"7 Dec 2015","2015","","","1","7","Design is considered by most to be the central activity of engineering. Also, it is known that engineering programs should graduate engineers who can design effectively to meet social and environmental needs. Though the role and perception of design across a wide range of educational institutions have improved markedly in recent years; however, both, design faculty & design practitioners argue that further improvements are necessary. One of the defining characteristics of design is that there is rarely a single correct answer to an engineering problem but, rather, an optimal or acceptable solution leading to a final design, presented as the best possible balance between technical as well as non-technical constraints. These nontechnical constraints typically involve economics, politics, social and environmental issues, ethics, etc. And, while professional practitioners generally accept this understanding of design, students, by enlarge, tend to interpret the engineering design process as an unambiguous and clearly defined process supported by rigidly applied principles and processes of “the scientific method.” Students' vision and mis-concepts of design do require proper alignment with prevailing conditions on the ground. Undoubtedly, the start of any design course should be preceded by exposure to design thinking and related processes. The paper reviews the role of design in engineering programs, and outlines the current research on how design thinking processes could be taught and learned. It explores also the currently most-favored pedagogical model for teaching design, namely: Project-Based Learning (PBL). The paper identifies several contexts for PBL, along with some available data on it success. Finally, the paper raises some of the questions that should be answered to identify the most effective pedagogical practices of improving design learning.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344190","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344190","Design education;design thinking;convergent & divergent thinking;project-based learning;the hybrid approach;team environment","Education;Uncertainty;Context;Data models;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic","","3","","30","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some technologies, including cyber-physical-system (CPS), Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, have been used in geological information management. Furthermore, the concept of cyber-physical-social-thinking (CPST) as a broader vision of the IoT was presented through the fusion of those advanced computing technologies. Motivated by it, in this paper we develop a novel modeling and computing method for geological information service system in consideration of the complex data processing requirement of geological service under dynamic environment.

Our principle interest is in CT framings and implementations for K-12 audiences in disciplines other than computer science, thus fulfilling the broad appeal and utility originally prescribed by Wing. We break CT down into its constituent characteristics, and split these characteristics into two principle groups: mechanistic (inextricably tied to and limited by computer science) and humanistic (separable from and adaptable beyond computer science). We use this conceptual bifurcation as a basis for selecting and analyzing implementations of CT for subsequent reporting. We summarize our CT meta-analytical results by distributional themes including grades, disciplinary foci, equity groups, and programming paradigms. In conclusion, we make recommendations for improving K-12 CT curricular implementations. Our hope is that utilization of CT characteristics and principles will become more commonplace in public education, be utilized more continuously through primary and secondary grades, and be inventively applied across a more inclusive range of academic disciplines.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344239","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344239","education;pedagogy;computational thinking;K-12;science education;computer science","Education;Writing;Programming profession;Computers;Google","","3","","9","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While the foundational paper for CAS provides a conceptual and theoretical basis of this new field, there is still a need to articulate useful guidelines and checkpoints that validate a CAS research agenda. In this position paper, we propose heuristics for assessing emerging CAS-related studies that researchers from traditional fields can use in their research design stage.

This project aims to explore the classroom effect of using graphical programming tool in learning English dialogue and investigate how to improve the integration of CT into English education with the elements of programming. To achieve these objectives, a qualitative method was adopted to collect data through class observations, programming projects, and semi-structured interviews. Nine primary students (n = 9) were the targeted participants, who attended extra-curricular lessons for computer programming using Scratch at their school in Hong Kong. The preliminary results show that the introduction of CT into English dialogue learning through graphical programming language can motivate primary school students to study English dialogue. To better connect CT with English education via graphical programming tools, students and the teacher in the group under study suggested making computers interact with people autonomically, designing games in graphical programming environments to encourage English learning, keeping the balance of students' graphical programming language learning skill and their English language skill, and adopting graphical programming language as a tool to finish the summative English language assignments.","2470-6698","978-1-5386-0900-2","10.1109/TALE.2017.8252356","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8252356","Computational Thinking;English dialogue learning;Graphical programming language;Classroom effect","Education;Tools;Programming profession;Computer languages;Interviews;Writing","","6","","19","IEEE","11 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"On bounded rationality in cyber-physical systems security: Game-theoretic analysis with application to smart grid protection","A. Sanjab; W.

In particular, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to analyze the interactions between one defender and one attacker over a CPS. In this game, the attacker launches cyber attacks on a number of cyber components of the CPS to maximize the potential harm to the physical system while the system operator chooses to defend a number of cyber nodes to thwart the attacks and minimize potential damage to the physical side. The proposed game explicitly accounts for the fact that both attacker and defender can have different computational capabilities and disparate levels of knowledge of the system. To capture such bounded rationality of attacker and defender, a novel approach inspired from the behavioral framework of cognitive hierarchy theory is developed. In this framework, the defender is assumed to be faced with an attacker that can have different possible thinking levels reflecting its knowledge of the system and computational capabilities. To solve the game, the optimal strategies of each attacker type are characterized and the optimal response of the defender facing these different types is computed. This general approach is applied to smart grid security considering wide area protection with energy markets implications. Numerical results show that a deviation from the Nash equilibrium strategy is beneficial when the bounded rationality of the attacker is considered. Moreover, the results show that the defender's incentive to deviate from the Nash equilibrium decreases when faced with an attacker that has high computational ability.","","978-1-5090-1164-3","10.1109/CPSRSG.2016.7684101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7684101","","Security;Games;Smart grids;Cyber-physical systems;Nash equilibrium;Silicon;Computational modeling","","31","","22","IEEE","27 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The cyber world is characterized by the following: 1) a lack of object permanence, which undermines the concept of maneuver; 2) limited or absent measurement of effectiveness in offensive cyber; 3) conflicts that are executed at computational speed, thus removing the time window for meaningful strategic leadership; and 4) anonymity, which makes the parties to the conflict unknown.

Our in vivo study examines how VEnvI can be used to teach fundamental computer science concepts such as sequences, loops, variables, conditionals, functions, and parallel programming. We aim to reach younger students through a fun and intuitive interface for choreographing dance movements with a virtual character. Our study contrasts the highly immersive and embodied virtual reality metaphor of using VEnvI with a non-immersive desktop metaphor. Additionally, we examine the effects of user attachment by comparing the learning results gained with customizable virtual characters in contrast with character presets. By analyzing qualitative and quantitative user responses measuring cognition, presence, usability, and satisfaction, we hope to find how virtual reality can enhance interest in the field of computer science among middle school students.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836179","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836179","","Programming profession;Virtual reality;Education;Computers;Three-dimensional displays;Programming environments","","5","","10","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Data for approximately 64 000 matches involving 185 000 players were taken from the LoLBase website. Match enjoyment was considered low when games lasted for 26 min or less (the earliest possible surrender time). Results from statistical analyses indicate that players with certain playing styles were more likely to enhance both game enjoyment and team strength.

Training data is granulated at different levels and data from each level is used for constructing the classification system. To evaluate performance of the proposed approach, a classification system based on neural network is implemented. Four medical datasets are used to compare performance of the proposed approach to other classifiers: neural network classifier, ANFIS classifier and SVM classifier. Results show that the proposed approach improves classification performance of neural network classifier and produces better accuracy and area under curve than other classifiers for most of the datasets used.","","978-1-4799-6926-5","10.1109/CIBCB.2015.7300328","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7300328","Artificial neural network;granular computing;data clustering;data classification","Support vector machines;Accuracy;Training data;Artificial neural networks;Training;Biological neural networks","","4","","19","IEEE","19 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Mathematics assessment tools still focus solely on this procedural side of understanding mathematics instead of the equally important conceptual aspect of learning mathematics. Given that math is an active process that encourages higher-order thinking and problem solving, an assessment focusing on the growth of conceptual understanding is required. The proposed research focuses on the development of a tool that will be used to assess current U.S. calculus students' ability to apply their conceptual understanding of a mathematic concept to scientific phenomena through modeling.

This teaching case describes how component content management and DITA were integrated into the Creating User Documentation course of an undergraduate professional writing program. Research questions: How can instructors of technical and professional writing best teach English and humanities students to operate within a structured authoring workflow? How can computational abstraction be combined with students' previously acquired genre knowledge to ease their adoption of the DITA to create technical documentation? Situating the case: The development of this course was informed by literature from a variety of scholarly and industry sources, which reveal connections between DITA, computational thinking, and Rhetorical Genre theory. Specifically, the concept of “layers of abstraction” guides the development of the course's structure, allowing students to separate and independently process the various aspects of a structured authoring workflow. How the case was studied: The case was studied informally through the experience of the authors as they developed and taught the course, through informal discussions and structured interviews with industry professionals, and through student reflections from discussion forum posts from Fall 2012 through Fall 2013. About the case: Initially developed with a focus on print manuals and online help, the course began teaching topic-based authoring in the mid-2000s; however, most enterprise-level editors and tools were cost-prohibitive for students and faculty. Furthermore, many computing concepts associated with structured authoring were intimidating for an audience of students in an English department. An affordable solution was adopting the open-source DITA standard, using free trials or open-source editors. The intimidation factor was minimized by designing the course around five layers of abstraction that draw on students' previous rhetorical knowledge: Layer 1: Developing quality documentation, Layer 2: Separating content from design, Layer 3: Authoring granular content with XML, Layer 4: Authoring and linking Component Content Management modules with DITA, and Layer 5: Single-sourcing and content reuse. This case discusses each layer of abstraction, the associated assignments for each layer, and the results of each layer based on student feedback. Results and conclusions: Although the course is not universally loved by students, it has seen many successes and provides a much-needed foundation in component content management and structured authoring for students who might become technical communicators. The teaching team has learned to avoid overemphasizing coding and automation in structured authoring, maintain a solid grounding on writing principles and good technical communication requirements, and draw upon students' existing knowledge of genres and their constraints.","1558-1500","","10.1109/TPC.2016.2516639","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7393614","Abstractions;computer languages;DITA;documentation;rhetoric;standards;writing;XML","Documentation;Content management;Computer languages;XML;Rhetoric;Writing","","21","","40","IEEE","26 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A fundamental challenge for almost all scientific disciplines is to explain how natural intelligence is generated by physiological organs and what the logical model of the brain is beyond its neural architectures. According to cognitive informatics and abstract intelligence, the exploration of the brain is a complicated recursive problem where contemporary denotational mathematics is needed to efficiently deal with it. Cognitive psychology and medical science were used to explain that the brain works in a certain way based on empirical observations on related activities in usually overlapped brain areas. However, the lack of precise models and rigorous causality in brain studies has dissatisfied the formal expectations of researchers in computational intelligence and mathematics, because a computer, the logical counterpart of the brain, might not be explained in such a vague and empirical approach without the support of formal models and rigorous means. In order to fonnally explain the architectures and functions of the brain, as well as their intricate relations and interactions, systematic models of t he brain are s ought for revealing the principles and mechanisms of the brain at the neural, physiological, cognitive, and logical (abstract) levels. Cognitive and brain informatics investigate into the brain via not only inductive syntheses through these four cognitive levels from the bottom up in order to form theories based on empirical observations, but also deductive analyses from the top down in order to explain various functional and behavioral instances according to the abstract intelligence theory. This keynote lecture presents systematic models of the brain from the facets of cognitive informatics, abstract intelligence, brain Informatics, neuroinformatics, and cognitive psychology. A logical model of the brain is introduced that maps the cognitive functions of the brain onto its neural and physiological architectures. This work leads to a coherent abstract intelligence theory based on both denotational mathematical models and cognitive psychology observations, which rigorously explains the underpinning principles and mechanisms of the brain. On the basis of the abstract intelligence theories and the logical models of the brain, a comprehensive set of cognitive behaviors as identified in the Layered Reference Model of the Brain (LRMB) such as perception, inference and learning can be rigorously explained and simulated.The logical model of the brain and the abstract intelligence theory of natural intelligence will enable the development of cognitive computers that perceive, think and learn. The functional and theoretical difference between cognitive computers and classic computers are that the latter are data processors based on Boolean algebra and its logical counterparts; while the former are knowledge processors based on contemporary denotational mathematics. A wide range of applications of cognitive computers have been developing in ICIC and my laboratory such as, inter alia, cognitive robots, cognitive learning engines, cognitive Internet, cognitive agents, cognitive search engines, cognitive translators, cognitive control systems, and cognitive automobiles.","","978-1-4799-0783-0","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2013.6622217","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6622217","Cognitive informatics;cognitive computing;abstract intelligence;denotational mathematics;cognitive computers;knowledge processors;inference engines;learning engines;perception engines;computational intelligence;applications","Abstracts;Brain modeling;Computational modeling;Data models;Engines;Informatics;Lead","","7","","22","IEEE","7 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Studies are typically longer and more “sophisticated” in terms of their perceived aesthetics or beauty. They are therefore likely a better test of the capability of machines to evaluate beauty in the game. Based on current validation methods for an aesthetics model such as this, the experimental results confirm that the adaptation was successful. In the first experiment, the new model enabled a computer program to distinguish correctly between composed studies and positions with sequences resembling studies taken from real games. In the second, the computational aesthetic evaluations were shown to correlate positively and well with human expert aesthetic assessment. The new model encompasses the previous three-mover one and can be used to evaluate beauty as perceived by humans in both domains. This technology pushes the boundaries of computational chess and can be of benefit to human players, composers, and judges. To some extent, it may also contribute to our understanding of the psychology of human aesthetic perception and the “mechanics” of human creativity in composing problems and studies.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2012.2192933","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6177652","Aesthetics;chess;creativty;endgame;perception","Humans;Games;Computational modeling;Computers;Adaptation models;Materials;Artificial intelligence","","12","","28","IEEE","3 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this exploratory and preliminary study, we investigate how appropriate the Bebras challenge is as an instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. Bebras is an international challenge whose goal is to promote Computer Science and CT. The test can be answered without any prior knowledge on computer science. Our broad research question is whether we can evolve Bebras into a full fledged instrument to assess and measure CT abilities. In this paper, we instantiate a few more specific research questions: Is Bebras performance a good predictor of success for students within programming courses? Is there any correlation between Bebras performance and students' grades? Do students improve their performance in Bebras tests when exposed to the contents of a programming course? Our dataset consists of the grades of 138 students who attended introductory programming courses at two Brazilian universities and their performance in two simulated Bebras tests. The first test was applied at the beginning of the term and therefore before any exposition to programming classes. The second one was applied at the end of the term. The results suggest that the performance on Bebras is only moderately correlated to the student grades. We conclude that it is not very likely that CT measures can be derived from the Bebras test as it is currently designed. While further research is needed on how we can leverage the Bebras effort to extend it into a CT assessment instrument, we performed a preliminary study on the use of Item Response Theory (IRT) as a means to improve the selection of questions and the design of the test. We expect the results of this research can contribute both to the development and discussion on CT assessment as well as to the Bebras effort to educate CT.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190652","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190652","","Instruments;Correlation;Programming profession;Problem-solving","","19","","24","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given a Petri net model with deadlocks, the TGAL approach first temporarily adds a global idle place (GP). A GP has initially only one token. Then, we generate the reachability graph of the net model with the GP. If there are deadlocks, we find all the legal markings and first-met bad markings (FBMs). The legal markings and FBMs that need to be considered can be reduced by using a vector covering approach. An integer linear programming problem is formulated to design a set of control places to forbid all FBMs but no legal markings. Meanwhile, the redundancy of the obtained control places is checked to remove the redundant ones. Then, we increase one token in the GP and compute a set of control place again. This process is carried out until the reachable markings of the Petri net model do not increase when the number of tokens in the GP is increased. As a result, we can find a set of control places to make the Petri net model live. Finally, some Petri net examples from the literature are used to demonstrate the proposed methods. It can be verified that the obtained supervisors can lead to more reachable markings, since the obtained control places are maximally permissive at each iteration.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2017.2720630","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61673309,61203038,61374068); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:JB160401,JBG160415); Recruitment Program of Global Experts; Science and Technology Development Fund, MSAR(grant numbers:078/2015/A3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7959575","Flexible manufacturing system;Petri net;deadlock prevention;think-globally-act-locally approach;maximally permissive supervisor","Petri nets;System recovery;Law;Computational modeling;Niobium;Complexity theory","","5","","56","OAPA","27 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, when using Easy JavaScript Simulation (EjsS) modeling toolkit, the instructor can be both the science educator and computer programmer, only needing to define the simulation variables, model and view, and the modeling toolkit can generate the computer codes for the physics simulation. Moreover, the programming aspects can become even more complex if simulations require being optimized for both Android and iOS mobile devices. The current version of EjsS provides instructors with an authoring tool that includes facilities for the creation of such JavaScript simulations as mobile apps, thus simplifying the purely programming aspects. This paper presents a new and novel EjsS functionality to generate physics simulation apps for iOS and Android.

Thus it is crucial to implement a virtual production system that supports learning from data and existing knowledge in the iterative design of models and their range of applicability - such a systematic design approach integrates real versus virtual data with digital versus human creativity and intelligence.

To technical level, the platform consists in two elements: a mobile application for Android operating system and a development board which the students can debugging their algorithms.

As educational framework, it has selected the concept of Computational Thinking (CT) in the stages of design of the platform. The CT is a kind of process that allows solve a problem through procedures such as abstraction, modeling, arguing and algorithmic processing. Furthermore, the CT allows the use of computers or tools such as mobile devices or both computational and mathematical programs as way to resolve the formulated problems in a knowledge area.

Our approach also addresses several issues concerning the use of conventional belief revision in human-like autonomous agents. In our approach, every goal produces a wishful thought about its achievement, in the form of a weak belief. Consequently, a “disliked situation” leads to inconsistent beliefs, thus triggering belief revision. Furthermore, the agent's belief set is selected based on a measure of preference that accounts for the “likeability” of beliefs (among other factors). We test an instantiation of our model to assess whether the resulting agent could produce the intended behaviors. The agent produces behaviors of denial and wishful thinking, not only as biases in belief selection, but also as the triggers to hold or reject certain beliefs.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2013.2247831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6496211","","Affective computing;Human factors;Emotion recognition;Human computer interaction;Behavioral science","","1","","21","IEEE","11 Apr 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education.

One such model is team-based learning (TBL) as originally developed by Larry Michaelsen in the late 1970s. TBL is a structured way to implement a flipped classroom approach, and has been shown to be successful in achieving deeper learning among the students. In this paper, we discuss our experience using the TBL methodology in a graduate computer engineering course on system level design of embedded systems. Specifically, we describe the course design, instructor experience adapting TBL for use in the course, including implementing an asynchronous online TBL process, and instructor reflections and student feedback on what worked well and what did not. We analyze the course content using the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, and assess the effectiveness of our implementation in achieving deeper learning.

The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) incorporates these societal and physical systems concerns within the framework of a large-scale optimization program which is divided into two main steps. Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing legal water rights regimes or agreements. Secondly, water and associated benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide welfare.

Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school.

Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. Triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. Understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in STEM learning. (1) Community: Middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. Adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.","","978-1-5090-0151-4","10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296518","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296518","","Physics;Statistics;Sociology;Computational modeling;User experience;Training;Textiles","","6","","","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool.

On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment.

To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.","","978-1-5090-2714-9","10.1109/ICRMS.2016.8050072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8050072","testability modeling;testability analysis;FMECA;multi-signal model","Analytical models;Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Signal processing;Testing;Fault detection;Data models","","1","","8","IEEE","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.","","978-1-5090-0641-0","10.1109/WACV.2016.7477725","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7477725","","Shape;Three-dimensional displays;Transmission line matrix methods;Computational modeling;Cameras;Solid modeling;Deformable models","","12","","42","IEEE","26 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.","","978-1-5090-2873-3","10.1109/CDC.2017.8264038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8264038","Rational Choice theory;Computational social choice;Distributed hypothesis testing;Bayesian inference;Computational complexity;Bayesian computations","Bayes methods;Nickel;Economic indicators;History;Computational complexity;Conferences","","3","","22","IEEE","22 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.","2377-634X","978-1-4799-3922-0","10.1109/FIE.2014.7044134","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7044134","computational thinking;CS4HS;teacher perceptions","Conferences;Educational institutions;Computers;Mathematics;Programming","","12","","24","IEEE","19 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.","1873-7951","","10.1093/iwc/iwu022","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8155009","development frameworks and environments;designing software;interactive learning environments;computational thinking;informal learning","","","4","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this article, the author outlines some frequent roles of code in computational science.

The attributed notes are presented in texts and characterized through the following six attributes: Character, Location, Object, Situation, Action, and Theme (CLOSAT) were used in this study to categorize the texts. We hope that stimulated through the pictures and attributed notes, users can better utilize creativity for their stories. In this study, we have implemented the PAN framework as a computer-aided system and conducted experiments to find out how one user would utilize the PAN system for story writing. Four participants were invited to create a story, including one without using the PAN system. We used content analysis to analyze the data through four main categories of coding: Conceptual, Operational, Perceptional and Evaluation (COPE), proposed by Chen [1].

The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse.

This paper explores the misperception associated with Computer Science and examines the efforts to make it more inclusive by attracting women, introducing CS earlier at the K-12 level, and improving entry-level college courses.","","978-1-5090-5510-4","10.1109/CSCI.2016.0067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881360","Computer Science;CS;Women;Diversity;K-12;Robotics;Adaptive Learning;ALS;ITS;Intelligent Tutoring;Breadth-First;Stereotype;AP;Adaptive Educational Hypermedia;AEH;Programming;Computational Thinking;STEM","Robots;Computers;Programming profession;Education;Problem-solving","","5","","72","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"The creativity mechanisms in embodied agents: An explanatory model","J. Wiedermann","Institute of Computer Science, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Prague, Czech Republic",2013 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Human-like Intelligence (CIHLI),"30 Sep 2013","2013","","","41","47","In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.","","978-1-4673-5923-8","10.1109/CIHLI.2013.6613263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613263","","Mirrors;Computational modeling;Semantics;Pragmatics;Abstracts;Oceans;Syntactics","","3","","17","IEEE","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.","","978-1-5090-0151-4","10.1109/RESPECT.2015.7296512","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296512","App Inventor;Broadening Participation;African American Student;computational thinking","History;Mobile applications;Education;Programming profession;Information science;Computer science education;Surveys","","2","","","IEEE","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method considers an individual's psychological characteristics in combination with logical thinking, which was introduced to individual passenger agents, to deduce each passenger's decision-making process when choosing the traffic mode and route. A series of computational experiments were conducted on the ATS by using a school bus system as a case study to validate the feasibility and superiority of our method. Several computational experiments were conducted to predict the traffic distribution in normal and abnormal traffic scenarios and to analyze the extent to which each factor influences the travel modal split. Furthermore, the outcomes of various vehicle-scheduling plans were predicted and analyzed by using computational experiments to determine the optimal plan and support the establishment of transportation policies in the real world.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2598252","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7547907","Agent-based modeling and simulation;belief–desire–intention (BDI) model;computational experiments;traffic distribution forecast;traffic mode choice forecast","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Vehicles;Predictive models;Gravity;Meteorology","","12","","24","IEEE","19 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Computer-based intelligent support for moderately Ill-structured problems","T. Hirashima","Dept. Information Engineering, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima, Japan",2017 3rd International Conference on Science in Information Technology (ICSITech),"15 Jan 2018","2017","","","1","6","Problems are often categorized into two types: ill-structured and well-structured, in the context of education/learning, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Then, from an educational viewpoint, ill-structured problems are further more important because they are useful to promote a learner to think about learning target deeply and to master computational or logical thinking skills, including metacognition. This paper proposes an additional characterization of problems by using two factors, (1) well/ill-structured domain model and (2) well/ill-structured problem setting. Based on this characterization, “moderately ill-structured problems” are defined as a category of problems specified by “well-structured domain model” and “ill-structured problem setting”. If a problem is set in well-structured domain model, it is possible to realize computer-based monitoring and diagnosis of learner's activities for the problem. If the problem setting is ill-structured, for example, open-ended, a learner is required to engage in the problem as ill-structured one. Therefore, moderately ill-structured problems are promising to realize computer-based intelligent support for solving ill-structured problems, while keeping educational advantages of ill-structured problems. In this paper, a definition of moderately ill-structured problems is described. Then, using the arithmetic word problems as an example of learning target domains, this paper describes (1) well-structured domain model of arithmetic word problems, and (2) design of moderately ill-structured problem as “problem-posing assignment” based on the domain model. Moreover, (3) implementation of an intelligent learning environment that requests a learner to solve ill-structured problems as problem-posing is introduced. The environment has functions to diagnose learner's behaviors and to give individual feedback.","","978-1-5090-5866-2","10.1109/ICSITech.2017.8257076","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8257076","Computer-based Intelligence Support;Ill-Structured Problem;Moderately Ill-Structured Problem;Domain Model;Problem Setting;Arithmetic Word Problems","Computational modeling;Information technology;Problem-solving;Monitoring;Numerical models;Artificial intelligence","","1","","24","IEEE","15 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In EarSketch, students write computer code to remix sound samples into original music compositions, often within hours of first exposure to the application. Coupled with sound samples rooted in modern music genres, EarSketch generates deep student engagement. We observed two unexpected challenges when implementing EarSketch in high school Computer Science Principles courses. First, music that appeals to the students' generation may be difficult for teachers to appreciate (and vice versa). Second, while a majority of students engaged in music production and coding, we observed that some students fixated on artistic musical expression without engaging in substantial computational thinking. These findings may apply more broadly in computational courses situated in expressive domains and to STEAM courses in general. We conclude with suggested changes to professional development, which may be applied more generally to creative computation and STEAM-based courses.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836171","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836171","music composition;computer science principles;student engagement;culture;STEAM","Music;Encoding;Education;Computer science;Interviews;Cultural differences;Computational modeling","","2","","9","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In 1990s, Computers is a required subject in junior high schools and an elective subject in senior high schools, along with many elementary schools offered computer classes. In 2000s, when ICT was popular in schools and families, Taiwan MOE (Ministry of Education) decided that ICT should be integrated into all subjects and Computers was excluded from the required learning areas in K-9 education. On the other hand, computing science was considered important in senior high schools and Introduction to ICT became a compulsory subject in 2006. As Taiwan will implement a twelve-year public education program, the MOE is undergoing revising the existed K-12 curriculum. This paper reports our recommendation on a new ICT curriculum to be implemented in K-12 schools. The recommended ICT curriculum is based on Delphi research methodology. The merit of Delphi technique is to form consensus among experts through several rounds of questionnaire survey. By reviewing the ICT curriculum from many developed countries and organizations, we drafted a preliminary ICT curriculum, including its strands, objectives, and framework. The study is still undergoing. The paper reports the preliminary results of the first stage of our Delphi survey.","","978-1-4799-3592-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821824","ICT;K-12 education;computing curriculum;Delphi method","Education;Standards;Government","","3","","10","IEEE","2 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main idea is to give the students the puzzles and ask them to “play” with the inputs and observe the outputs enough to determine the internal mechanisms or principles that produce particular outputs from given inputs. First year students were asked to define a formula or describe a principle, based on which the input transforms itself into the output. There were four different types of answers: the student could be able (1) to state a formal proof, (2) to state a verbal proof, (3) to state a basic concept of algorithms, or (4) not to state any type of correct solution.

However, as new computer technologies emerge continuously and rapidly, it is required for this course to accommodate more and more knowledge. Therefore the teaching contents are growing enormously, which makes it very difficult to cover all of them in limited hours, and therefore sets an obstacle in understanding computing principles and building up a clear and general picture of computing, especially for non-major students. As computer science and technology are becoming more and more essential for various disciplines and majors, it is urgent for the education community to find out an effective and propagable way to solve this problem. In this regard, we employ virtual reality technology to the experiment teaching of this course, and have developed 18 virtual experiments to support the whole teaching process. For example, Turing machine is a basic model for computer science and technology. However, since it is not a real machine, it is not easy for the students to imagine the working process of Turing machine and understand the related concepts. Another example, the execution of an instruction is very important to understand the principles of computer organization. However, as the information flow is invisible, it is difficult and time-consuming for the teachers to explain how an instruction is executed inside a computer. Therefore, 3D modeling and animation techniques are used to demonstrate the invisible micro-structure of computers, and human-machine interaction and visualization techniques are used to present the internal process of information evolution, thus constructing a complete virtual experiment system of this course, including demonstration experiments, verification experiments and interaction experiments. Our virtual experiments have applied software copyrights and served more than 12,000 students from five universities of China since 2013. The evaluation demonstrates that the virtual experiments have produced excellent results in both teaching effectiveness and learning efficiency, relieved the conflicts between limited hours and vast knowledge, and helped students understand and build up the knowledge of computing.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344376","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344376","virtual experiments;Introduction to Computing;virtual reality","Computers;Random access memory;Education;Turing machines;Computational modeling;Computer science;Animation","","8","","10","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, there are indications in the literature that we do not yet know the pedagogical best practices associated with their use to maximize learning. This project couples student use of interactive simulations with the gathering of real-time formative assessment via pen-enabled mobile technology (in this case, Tablet PCs). The research question addressed in this paper is: are learning gains achieved with this coupled model greater for certain types of learners in the undergraduate engineering classroom? To answer this, we correlate learning gains with various learning styles, as identified using the Index of Learning Styles (ILS) developed by Felder and Soloman. These insights will be useful for others who use interactive computer simulations in their instruction and other adopters of this pedagogical model; the insights may have broader implications about modification of instruction to address various learning styles.","2377-634X","978-1-4673-1352-0","10.1109/FIE.2012.6462281","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6462281","learning styles;interactive simulations;real-time formative assessment;active learning;InkSurvey","Computational modeling;Real-time systems;Engineering education;Physics;Integrated circuit modeling;Reliability","","1","","26","IEEE","18 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research attempts to answer the question and tries to determine what factors can affect an employee to become a chief and capable to achieve performance target. To address the question, this study adopts predictive modelling approach using classification techniques and kl-divergence function. The research proposes some recommendations based on applied algorithm. Additionally, the study shows it is easier to choose a chief based on their historical data compare to predicting which employee can perform well in the future or predicting both potential chief and high performer employees.

The submarine maneuver control system is a nonlinear six degree of freedom model, which has the great inertia variational parameters and many other complex characters. It is difficult for single PID to control the system because of the complex characters. In many instances, the best control is obtained in the manual mode using experienced operators. Fuzzy control translates the thinking of experienced operators into control algorithm, which has proven effective for complex, nonlinear, imprecisely-defined model. In order to advance the control effect, fuzzy theory is introduced and simulation experiments are carried out in this paper. The result shows that fuzzy PID control designed for the unstable nonlinear model of submarine maneuver respond more rapidly and robustly than single PID control.","","978-1-4673-1744-3","10.1109/ICACI.2012.6463199","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6463199","","PD control;Underwater vehicles;Niobium;Fuzzy control;Mathematical model;Equations","","","","6","IEEE","18 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Informatics and computer sciences are continuously developing new information-storage devices and a multitude of software more rapidly than ever. However, effective information search and processing require an information literacy which the new generations characteristically, and more and more demonstrably, do not have. National and international empirical research proves that the algorithmic thinking of the younger generations, which is indispensable for the world of informatics, is underdeveloped when it comes to the effective and productive use of digital tools. Moreover, the phenomenon of hyper attention invades the everyday life and the learning habits of the younger generation to a greater and greater degree. The essence of the HY-DE model is to aid the students' learning process with the help of the teacher's purposeful control of the phases of attention (hyper, mixed and deep attention). One aim of the present study is to introduce a new application of the HY-DE model, entitled Data-Structure Validator HY-DE model (DaSVa HY-DE). In the introductory phase, the DaSVa model focuses on how the HY-DE attention-divisions manifest themselves in webpage-search as well as in the information retrieval that it yields, and what the roles of the hyper, mixed, and deep attention modes are in the development of computational thinking and algorithmic skills. In the full hyper attention status the search for specified contents is carried out, focusing on webpages which consist of data organized in table or table-like structures. The automated and semi-automated conversion of the webpages however requires the decreasing of hyper attention leading to deep or mixed attention. The final result of this conversion process is/are well-structured table(s) suitable for automated data retrieval in spreadsheets, database management, and programming. The application of the original HY-DE model would lead us to its modification. In the advanced phase of the DaSVa HY-DE model the students can also experience how the webpages are designed and structured, how they support information and data retrieval, how successful the algorithmic based retrieval can be, and how the approach would lead students to the application of the theory of well-structured webpage design. With this model, from the hyper attention data collection status, through a deep and/or mixed attention algorithm building and data analyzing process, students would reach a higher-level hyper attention, the developer status.","","978-1-5386-1264-4","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2017.8268242","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8268242","information literacy;computational thinking;hyper and deep attention;data structure;webpage conversion","Tools;Computational modeling;Education;Informatics;Data structures;Media;Software","","5","","18","IEEE","25 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A system of formal concept generation for a cognitive robot is implemented by the Algorithm of Machine Concept Elicitation (AMCE) in MATLAB. Experiments on machine learning for creating a set of twenty formal concepts reveal that the cognitive robot is able to learn synergized concepts in human knowledge in order to build its own cognitive knowledge base.

Most importantly, our proposed approach guarantees to find the globally optimal solution of the non-convex polynomial programming problem by solving a sequence of convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problems based on convexification.

Achieving efficient parallel simulation of scale-free networks is challenging because large-degree nodes can create bottlenecks that limit performance. To help address this problem we describe an approach called link partitioning where each network link is mapped to a logical process (LP) in contrast to the conventional approach of mapping each network node to an LP. Link partitioning is discussed in the context of packet-level simulations of telecommunication networks. The parallelism of link partitioning relative to node partitioning is examined in terms of an idealized execution using the well-known YAWNS synchronization algorithm. Further, a critical path analysis suggests that there is much more parallelism available in these simulations than can be exploited using the YAWNS algorithm.","1550-6525","978-1-5090-3505-2","10.1109/DS-RT.2016.17","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7789874","parallel discrete event simulation;scale-free networks;simulation model;conservative synchronization;power law distribution","Ports (Computers);Switches;Parallel processing;Synchronization;Computational modeling;Partitioning algorithms;Fabrics","","3","","16","IEEE","19 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is an upward trend towards STEAM-focused curricula driven by the decline in academic scores, which provides more challenges for our youth to compete in the global workforce; and recognizing that STEAM builds upon math as the interconnection between the science and art disciplines, thus expanding career opportunities and experience that ensure a well-rounded citizenry. We are rediscovering the need for balancing the cognitive and logical sides of the brain with the creative force to engender an agile, growth-driven nationwide community.","","978-1-5090-5379-7","10.1109/ISECon.2017.7910235","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7910235","STEAM;Immersion learning;problem-based learning;Project Fibonacci®;Communities of interest","Art;Biological system modeling;STEM;Engineering profession;Business;Conferences","","2","","18","IEEE","27 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The current state of technology is characterized by deterministic thinking and practices. Fact is that all available data and information are characterized by uncertainty. An adequate consideration is necessary. The contribution gives an overview about approaches and methods for the numerical structural design, which consider the uncertainty of the data (a priori and design parameters). As the basis of the uncertainty modeling, the definition of polymorphic uncertainty models is proposed, to take real-world scenarios into account. Polymorphic uncertainty models allow the incorporation of the uncertainty characteristics variability (randomness), imprecision and incompleteness simultaneously. The direct consideration of data uncertainty in design tasks is for the optimization and the solution of the inverse problem not possible, due to the missing of rules for comparing uncertain quantities. An efficient approach is the formulation of surrogate models, differing in the order of evaluation uncertainty and solving the optimization task. This contribution presents the well known passive (""wait-and-see"") and active (""here-and-now"") approach for numerical design tasks analyzed with optimization or solving the inverse problem. The advantages and disadvantages of each concept are pointed out and the applicability, especially in early stages of design is demonstrated. Furthermore, numerical structural analysis, assessments, replacement models and reduction methods with uncertain data are outlined, leading to an efficient numerical design and to practical engineering solutions. This contribution demonstrates algorithms and methods for the numerical design concepts under consideration of polymorphic uncertainty models, by applying different surrogate models. Surrogate models allow the application of an appropriate uncertainty model. Suitable approaches for increasing numerical efficiency are reduction methods and replacement models among others. Reduction methods include model reduction, reducing the number of function calls and the complexity (e.g., The dimensionality with sensitivities). Replacement models are, e.g., Physically motivated and analytical metamodels. Analytical metamodel can be distinguished into approximation and classification methods. Numerically efficient classification algorithms are, e.g., Support Vector Machines or Self-Organizing Maps. Efficient approximate metamodels are, e.g., Artificial Neural Networks, Radial Basis Function Networks, and Extreme Learning Machines. The applicability of approach are demonstrated by means of engineering examples.","","978-1-4799-7560-0","10.1109/SSCI.2015.254","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7376831","","Uncertainty;Optimization;Numerical models;Linear programming;Random variables;Inverse problems;Stochastic processes","","","","22","IEEE","11 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The arrival and the development of computers and the Internet offer a turning point in English learning methodology. Promoting student's autonomy in English learning has become an urgent task. What EFL teachers in China need to do now is to modernize English teaching and combine the new with the old so as to adapt the communicative approach to traditional teaching structures. The level-based college English teaching model combined with information technology can not only facilitate the cultivation of professional teachers with teaching proficiency and researching potential but also develop students' creative thinking, promote the students' cross-cultural awareness and strengthen the emotional communication as well. Teachers can utilize the network resources to provide students with a rich visual learning reference, which caters for classroom teaching, students' self-learning and improves teaching efficiency.

Previously, multiple experiments studied the level of recursive reasoning generally displayed by humans while playing sequential general-sum and fixed-sum, two-player games. The results show that subjects experiencing a general-sum strategic game display first or second level of recursive thinking with the first level being more prominent. However, if the game is made simpler and more competitive with fixed-sum payoffs, subjects predominantly attributed first-level recursive thinking to opponents thereby acting using second level. In this article, we model the behavioral data obtained from the studies using the interactive partially observable Markov decision process, appropriately simplified and augmented with well-known models simulating human learning and decision. We experiment with data collected at different points in the study to learn the models parameters. Accuracy of the predictions by our models is evaluated by comparing them with the observed study data, and the significance of the fit is demonstrated by comparing the mean squared error of our model predictions with those of a random hypothesis. Accuracy of the predictions by the models suggest that these could be viable ways for computationally modeling strategic behavioral data in a general way.

These representations enable diverse, asynchronous cognitive processes to be dynamically activated according to rapidly changing contexts, much like in biological cognition. The recent completion of the LIDA Framework, a software API supporting the domain-independent LIDA Model, allows the construction of domain-specific agents that test the Model and/or enhance traditional machine learning algorithms with human-style problem solving.

While various curriculum design and instructional methods have been explored in recent years, an effective way to assess students' novel discoveries and creativity remains a great challenge. This paper investigates into a relatively new text analytics computational approach to facilitate instructors of identifying and assessing the concrete evidences of students' achievements under a DEC-based pedagogical approach. In particular, we illustrate a topic modeling-based text mining method which can extract the hidden intents and creative ideas of students embedded in their project work.

However, the computational burden is very heavy as there are many agents interacting in parallel in the ATS. Therefore, a parallel computing tool is desirable. We think that we can employ a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), which has been applied in many areas. In this paper, we use a GPU-adapted Parallel Genetic Algorithm (PGA) to solve the problem of generating daily activity plans for individual and household agents in the ATS, which is important as the activity plans determine the traffic demand in the ATS. Previous research has shown that GA is effective but that the computational burden is heavy. We extend the work to GPU and test our method on an NVIDIA Tesla C2050 GPU for two scenarios of generating plans for 1000 individual agents and 1000 three-person household agents.

The recent endorsement of 23 AI principles by 1200 AI/Robotics researchers and over 2342 other researchers from diverse disciplines, in a just concluded Future of Life (FLI) Conference, adds credence to the worries which most researchers have about the presumed benefits of AI to mankind. The study draws from a combination of Marxian Alienation and ontological theories which basically holds that: rising advancements in AI technologies, continues to alienate mankind from his existential human nature. The ex-post facto research design in the social sciences and Deriders' deconstructive and critical reconstructive analytic method in philosophy, for interrogating the meaning of concepts, arguments and current debates on the relevance and risks of IA, were adopted for the study.

Because of its importance in understanding natural language semantics, it becomes one of the most challenging issues within this field. In this paper, we present an enhanced knowledge-based word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithm that manipulates by calculating the semantic similarity between definitions of the target word and an extended syntactic context vector. The actual meaning of the target word is identified as that for which the semantic similarity between definition and extended syntactic context vector is highest. Therefore, while traditional WSD approaches are based on semantic information, our method is built on both semantic and syntactic relations between sentences. This allows it to take advantage of a better use of comprehensive knowledge and more in line with the human being way of thinking. For the sake of improving the performance of WSD, we combine the syntactic importance of the words within the original document piece to provide a sequence that can be used to decide which words should be disambiguated. Finally, the evaluation performed on two standard datasets shows that our algorithm goes better beyond the baselines and has more desirable features than other popular algorithms.","","978-1-5386-3371-7","10.1109/IEMCON.2017.8117155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8117155","word sense disambiguation;knowledge-based;syntactic context;syntactic importance","Syntactics;Semantics;Knowledge based systems;Natural language processing;Feature extraction;Computational complexity","","2","","21","IEEE","23 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Teng",NA,Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis,"","2016","","","","","In the age of Big Data, efficient algorithms are in higher demand more than ever before. While Big Data takes us into the asymptotic world envisioned by our pioneers, it also challenges the classical notion of efficient algorithms: Algorithms that used to be considered efficient, according to polynomial-time characterization, may no longer be adequate for solving today's problems. It is not just desirable but essential that efficient algorithms should be scalable. In other words, their complexity should be nearly linear or sub-linear with respect to the problem size. Thus, scalability, not just polynomial-time computability, should be elevated as the central complexity notion for characterizing efficient computation. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis surveys a family of algorithmic techniques for the design of scalable algorithms. These techniques include local network exploration, advanced sampling, sparsification, and geometric partitioning. They also include spectral graph-theoretical methods, such as are used for computing electrical flows and sampling from Gaussian Markov random fields. These methods exemplify the fusion of combinatorial, numerical, and statistical thinking in network analysis. Scalable Algorithms for Data and Network Analysis illustrates the use of these techniques by a few basic problems that are fundamental in analyzing network data, particularly for the identification of significant nodes and coherent clusters/communities in social and information networks. It also discusses some frameworks beyond graph-theoretical models for studying conceptual questions that arise in network analysis and social influences.","","9781680831313","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187499.pdf&bkn=8187498&pdfType=book","Algorithmic game theory;Computational aspects of combinatorics and graph theory;Computational complexity;Computational geometry;Computational Models and Complexity;Data structures;Design and analysis of algorithms;Operations Research;Parallel algorithms;Randomness in Computation;Data Mining;Economics of information and the Web;Scalability;Social Networking;Spectral methods;Robustness;Optimization;Markov chain Monte Carlo;Graphical models;Game theoretic learning;Dimensionality reduction;Data mining;Clustering;Web search;Natural language processing for IR","","","","","","","15 Dec 2017","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

The knowledge of the arterial hemodynamics resulted due to atherosclerosis with different level of blood viscosity can clarify the relationship between artery stenosis and symptoms, and, finally, the risk of heart attack and stroke. Hence proficient imaging of blood flow has great clinical importance to understand the origin and evolution of disease. Therefore, investigation and detection of viscosity change and its effect might be helpful for better diagnosis of carotid atherosclerosis. In this simulation work, hemo-disturbances are studied in a carotid artery finite element model (FEM) with atherosclerosis under different viscosities consideration using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The obtained FEM data are used to reconstruct color flow image of blood velocities using ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) signals to study atherosclerosis detecting the viscosity changes. The findings of this study suggest that ultrasound based blood flow image can detect the viscosity change effect related to atherosclerosis growth.

It leads to changes on system requirements, hoping to improve systems with attractive creativity features. Consequently, creative computing is aroused as an emerging research field in software engineering. Currently, there are researches working on approaches and processes to develop creative software from scratch. However, evolving existing systems can achieve the same purpose, though it is hard to add creativity features to legacy systems by traditional software evolution approaches. Obviously, based on experiences over decades from software community, development from scratch might cause a waste in terms of resources. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a Model Driven Architecture based reverse engineering method for creative evolution. Abstraction techniques are explored, classified, designed and applied in this proposed approach. Meanwhile, details and roles of abstraction techniques were developed for each step. Also, an e-learning system is chosen as a case study to illustrate, validate and evaluate the proposed method. Overall, our work aims to contribute to software evolution methodology and its application creatively.","","978-1-9095-2202-2","10.1109/IConAC.2014.6935462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6935462","reverse engineering;abstraction;Model-Driven Architecture;creativity;evolution","Software;Reverse engineering;Computer integrated manufacturing;Object oriented modeling;Aging;Computer architecture;Computational modeling","","1","","21","","27 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We tried to verify a hypothesis that learners to create an artifact with good quality make a number of trials and errors during the editing process. We collected the fine-grained data regarding the editing history of class diagrams created by learners by our tool called KIfU. We verified the hypothesis by analyzing the collected data. First, we defined two metrics (""Number of editing"" and ""Number of movement"" of symbols in the artifact) calculated from the data that show the learners' trials and errors. Second, we divided learners into two groups, group that created artifacts with good quality and that with not good quality. Finally, we compared the metrics between the groups. The results show that there are statistically significantly differences of values of both metrics between the groups.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of an extreme learning machine (ELM) for classifying a number of different thoughts when given a relatively small amount of training samples from a 5-channel EEG headset. We transform the electroencephalograph (EEG) data to a set of features for the input of the ELM model by estimating the logarithmic power (LP) of the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) coefficients, which corresponds to five different frequency bands. The ELM provides up to a 90% to 100% classification accuracy depending on training samples and number of hidden nodes, compared to 52% to 60% for a multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

In previous research with AgentSheets, we concluded that the semiotic richness of this visual programming environment, specifically designed to support computational thinking acquisition, could be explored more extensively to the benefit of learners. In particular, we realized that there are some additional representations of AgentSheets games and simulations that are not presented as programming tools in the interface, and yet they communicate new relevant meanings to the users. This paper reports on research where we artificially introduced such representations in a small follow-up experiment with selected participants from our previous research experiment. Our goal was to investigate the impact of such additional representations on program comprehension and modification tasks. To this end we contrasted empirical evidence of their performance in the two tasks with their verbal account of experience with AgentSheets. We used a combination of discourse analysis and inspections using Semiotic Engineering methods and the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. Our findings go in two directions. First, we observed that additional representations have allowed participants to expand and correct previous learning. Therefore such representations can support new teaching strategies in computational thinking acquisition programs with AgentSheets. Second, we learned that the combination of methods we used to analyze empirical data - discourse analysis with semiotic and cognitive inspection techniques - can be used systematically in other research contexts, holding the promise of insightful results.","1943-6106","978-1-4673-0853-3","10.1109/VLHCC.2012.6344492","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6344492","computational thinking;end-user programming;visual programming;cognitive dimentions of notations;semiotic engineering methods","Visualization;Games;Semiotics;Programming;Marine animals;Interviews;Inspection","","6","","12","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It focuses on the transformation and application of front-end users' experience on the process of design prototyping research, and also on the researcher's implementation of research methods and the planning of design process in cross-domain design research.","","978-89-88678-68-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6268544","co-design;participants;design research;case studies;front-end users' experience","Abstracts;Communities;Positron emission tomography","","","","18","","16 Aug 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This project aims to help Secondary School girls develop an insight into the role computers play in society and to learn some of the key skills in computing including computer programming. Exposure to Computer Science, in home or school environments, and encouragement from family and peers are leading factors that influence girls' decisions to pursue careers in Computer Science. Other factors include the girls' perception of their own problem solving ability, an understanding of the diverse applications of Computer Science and related career paths and the potential for positive social impact. This paper describes the design of an after school computing programme, CodePlus, which uses a novel 21st Century learning model. Pre and post questionnaire are being used to explore girls intentions to study CS, their confidence to study CS, perception of CS as a career, gender perception of CS and IT profession and self-efficacy following participation in the CodePlus programme. Preliminary results comparing pre questionnaire results with a male control group highlight differences in how girls see themselves in terms of CS capabilities and their future potential. Initial post questionnaire findings show a significant increase in the participants' perceived programming ability.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344113","Computing;21C Learning;Programming;Scratch;Computational thinking;Collaborative learning","Computers;Programming profession;Engineering profession;Conferences;Education","","18","","29","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are numerous games and each game has a different set of rules and different set of strategies for playing them. Though the design model of the game is similar to a set of particular games of the same domain, still we have to have a different strategic model for every individual game. The strategy design for these games also has to be different. Hence the paper proposes a new model for the design of game strategy by generalising the approach. Virtual generation of various strategies with the inter-application of basic strategies and complex strategies from various set of games into one another is the proposed algorithm. This gives a new approach entirely to the modelling of game strategies. It does so with the help of trained networks which are dynamically created and virtually maintained. This paper proposes a entire new approach in game modelling; more generalized and a more integrated approach.","","978-1-4673-4937-6","10.1109/ECAI.2013.6636191","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6636191","IGA (Idea Generation Algorithm);Game;Strategy;neural networks;lateral thinking;ANN (Artificial Neural Network);Computational;Artificial Intelligence;IGSDA (Inter-applicative Game Strategy Design)","Games;Algorithm design and analysis;Heuristic algorithms;Artificial neural networks;Artificial intelligence;Databases;Containers","","","","10","IEEE","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent studies conducted in the US have shown that not only do high school students lack any exposure, but also they possess ill-conceived notions of what computer science is, a problem also affecting their parents, teachers and regional school superintendents. For incoming students, the extent to which computing technology impacts their daily lives is very likely at odds with the extent to which they have considered how software works and its ethical implications. The ability to critically analyze and consider related ethical consequences of computing is an important life skill for every twenty-first century adult and not just computer scientists. With this this in mind, this paper presents a unique CS0 introduction to programming and computer ethics for pre CS and non majors. It has been defined as a service course to promote digital literacy and to ensure that students appreciate what computer science is and its socio-ethical implications.

"Pattern of Reflection in Learning for Predicting Students' Performance","S. K. Mohamad; Z. Tasir","Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Skudai, Johor, MY",2014 International Conference on Teaching and Learning in Computing and Engineering,"2 Jun 2014","2014","","","145","146","Some complex problems in the computational area are learning programming and algorithms. Authoring system is a subject that can be considered as complex as it integrates the use of scripting language like Action Script in Flash, Active Server Pages (ASP) and Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP). The normal problem that resides when it comes to programming is handling error as it is not an easy task and for those who are new, might find this very troublesome. Handling the error requires proper planning and skills in analyzing problem which students usually lack at. Reflection in learning is really helpful in helping students learn the Authoring System subject effectively as they are encourage to share ideas, experiences and perspective actively on the emerging issues of Action Script topic especially in discussing the concepts and errors. With the need for reflection in developing the required skills in learning Authoring System, how then do we ensure and measure the quality in student reflection journals and its contact in assessing the subject content and students' performance in learning? Quality is defined as ""processes or outcomes"" [1]. In the context of this research study, quality is determined by assessing the progression of reflective processes based on the interventions given. As an educator, we need to be aware on how new technologies act as the engagers and facilitators in the reflection purposes. Blog is one of the emerging technologies that can offer such pedagogical benefits as reflective tools and social affordances across disciplines provided that one can read and make comments that lead to meaningful discussion for common interests and individual differences [2]. Although blogging enable deep reflection in each individual blogs, somehow it failed to encourage peer feedback to each other blogs and collaboration among students to support reflective thinking as expected [3]. This problem exists probably due to the minimum used of blog technical features and also the absence of activities and guidelines to elevate collaborative reflection process to take place [4]. Students' familiarity with the blog technology cannot guarantee them with the skills to use it efficiently in educational setting. They still need further expose and training on how technologies can be used beyond the technological sake [4]. Besides the use of blogs, the design of the activities should not simply indicate the progress towards the solution of the problem if to allow reflective thinking to occur. The use of case-based learning can support reflective thinking among students in learning computer-based subject. However, the implementation of case-based learning requires the presence of an instructor to guide students to solve the subject matter at hand. Instructors are therefore encouraged to regulate students thinking by integrating the metacognitive strategies in learning necessary for academic success and students should also be granted with the opportunity in using this strategy to boost the likely for students to reflect on their task and therefore contributed to their experience as a community of learners. Unfortunately, many students failed to directly engage in metacognitive thinking unless they are shown ways to do so through prudently designed instructional activities. Thus, it is vital to embed metacognitive support in the design of learning environment especially when dealing with computer education subject which involves lots of technical aspects. This study believes that the integrations of several approaches as mentioned above can granted a green light in nurturing and achieving good quality in students' reflection. In this study, the quality is heavily relied on the use of feedback either from the instructors to students or among students themselves. Most of studies regarding the reflection done before only focusing on rating students' reflection journals all alone without considering other factors that may impacting certain levels of reflection. Therefore, this study is intended to identify the impact of provision of feedback in determining the quality of students' reflection and predicting the students' performance in learning Authoring System subject. This study will employ a quantitative research design which involves the use of pre-experimental design of one group pretest-posttest type. It will be conducted in one whole semester and will involve postgraduate students who registered for Authoring System subject. Three research instruments will be used in this study: questionnaires, performance test, and student's reflection in blogs. 1. Questionnaire: -There will be two questionnaires administered in this research study. The first questionnaire is about students' perceptions regarding the educational benefits of reflection through blogging while the second questionnaire is about the students' perceptions regarding the provision of feedback both from the peers and instructors. Both questionnaires are self-developed by the researchers and will be analyzed using the Rasch Model analysis technique which is run using Win steps software. By using Rasch Model, the findings will be more interesting and meaningful as from the students' psychometrics, researchers are able to dig into detail about the real relations between students and the measureable items. 2. Performance test: -The performance test is consists of several questions on Authoring System which cover the topic on Flash and Dreamweaver. It will be administered at the last session of the semester and is graded based on the answer scheme. The performance score will later be used in data mining analysis technique through Weka software in order to predict student's performance based on the pattern of reflection among students in learning the aforementioned subject. 3. Observations and analysis of students' reflections in blogs: -Throughout the semester, student's blogs will be monitored in order to observe their activities and to encourage them to do the reflection critically. Apart from the weekly reflections, several minicases activities will be posted in the instructor's blog and students are required to make critical reflections on each mini case. The minicase is designed to help students to apply concepts and suitable for practical in lab settings [5]. The cases will be created based on real-life practices and also from the problems encountered by the students while completing the class activities. Students' postings in the blogs will be analyzed via content analysis technique. The qualitative postings from the blogs which originally in the form of text will be coded using the four levels of reflective thinking framework by [6] and this action will transformed the qualitative data into quantitative data in terms of the frequency of occurrence. In order to measure the quality of reflection, the following analyses will be taken into account [7]: 1. Overall frequency of posting given by instructors and students. 2. Nature of posting by instructors and students (answers, questions, or mix of both). 3. Timing of the posting (during or end of forum). 4. How the postings style evolve from one level of reflective thinking to another as a result of provision of feedback by instructors and students. The general outcome of doing reflection is learning. However, this study is expected to achieve more than that. The upshot of this study will determine the quality in students' reflection and also the dominant level of reflective thinking. The outcome will further validate similar studies which previously conducted concerning the reflective thinking skills with the integration of technology, pedagogical aspects of learning for active involvement and how the students' psychometrics from the developed questionnaires can addressed the crucial information about the way students gain information and learning.","","978-1-4799-3592-5","10.1109/LaTiCE.2014.34","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6821844","Blog;Data Mining;Metacognitive scaffolding;Rasch Model;Reflection;Reflective thinking","Reflection;Blogs;Education;Authoring systems;Mathematics;Multimedia communication;Programming","","","","7","IEEE","2 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Yet for all their power, these machines still cannot perform simple tasks that a child can do, such as navigating an unknown room or using a pencil. The solution is finally coming within reach. It will emerge from the intersection of two major pursuits: the reverse engineering of the brain and the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence. Over the next 20 years, these two pursuits will combine to usher in a new epoch of intelligent machines. Why do we need to know how the brain works to build intelligent machines? Although machine-learning techniques such as deep neural networks have recently made impressive gains, they are still a world away from being intelligent, from being able to understand and act in the world the way that we do. The only example of intelligence, of the ability to learn from the world, to plan and to execute, is the brain. Therefore, we must understand the principles underlying human intelligence and use them to guide us in the development of truly intelligent machines.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2017.7934229","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934229","","Neurons;Computers;Artificial intelligence;Fires;Face;Pattern recognition","","17","","","IEEE","29 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However, these methods didn't take human errors in risk assessment work into consideration, thus couldn't solve the problem brought by the influence of human errors on final assessment results. As a result, this paper introduces the Technique for Human Error Rate Prediction (THERP) which is a mature technique in human reliability analysis into the process of information security risk assessment. Combined with current analysis techniques of human errors in computer science and aiming at the calculation process of the risk value of important assets in information security risk assessment, research on the calculation method of risk value considering human reliability is carried out in this paper.

In this study, we try to interpret a single hidden layer MLP by discretizing the hidden neuron outputs into 3 values (e.g. -1, 0, and 1). The 3 values correspond to false, unknown, and true, respectively. The basic process is (1) train an MLP first, (2) discretize the hidden neurons, (3) retrain the output layer of the MLP, (4) add more hidden neurons if needed, and (5) induce a decision tree based on the hidden neuron outputs. Experiments on several public datasets show that the proposed method is feasible for acquiring interpretable knowledge.","","978-1-5386-2201-8","10.1109/CYBConf.2017.7985786","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985786","","Neurons;Decision trees;Training;Cancer;Iris;Ionosphere;Iris recognition","","2","","10","IEEE","20 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem appears because the students come with serious deficiencies from their previous education level (secondary schools). Among these deficiencies, we identify their lack of abstraction capabilities and mathematical skills, which are usually considered as prerrequisites to take a programming course. This article introduces the GOBSTONES method for teaching an introductory programming course. The method was developed at the Universidad Nacional de Quilmes in Argentina, taking into account the described background of the students, and has shown a positive impact by improving the passing rate of those students. GOBSTONES method's main goal was to foster abstraction and abstract thinking to students that have not developed good abstraction skills. A programming language, also called GOB-STONES, was developed to implement the ideas presented herein. The method focuses on the representation of information, both at the level of code in the form of procedures to express abstraction, and at the level of the universe of discourse, which is a concrete one, but allowing the representation of information in a simple way. Moreover, the tools implementing GOBSTONES have a feature that enables the student to see a visualization of the represented elements.","","978-1-5386-3057-0","10.1109/CLEI.2017.8226428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8226428","Teaching programming method;Introductory course on programming;Gobstones language","Programming profession;Education;Computer languages;Concrete;Computational modeling","","2","","27","IEEE","21 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of parameter selections.

This paper proposes a novel approach based on closed-loop brain storm optimization (CLBSO) algorithms to address the optimal formation reconfiguration of multiple satellites using two-impulse control. The optimal satellite formation reconfiguration is formulated as an optimization problem with the constraints of overall fuel cost minimization, final configuration, and collision avoidance. Three versions of CLBSOs are developed by replacing the creating operator in basic brain storm optimization (BSO) with closed-loop strategies, which facilitate search characteristic capture and enhance the optimization performance by taking advantage of feedback information in the search process. Numerical simulations are carried out using particle swarm optimization (PSO), basic BSO, and the three versions of CLBSOs. Comparison results show that all versions of CLBSOs outperform PSO and the original BSO in terms of final results and convergence speed. In addition, CLBSO reduces the computation burden and shortens CPU time to a certain extent in contrast with basic BSO. Furthermore, among the three CLBSO algorithms, the one using the strategy of difference with the best gains the best overall performance, which is inspired by the updating rule in PSO that each particle tends to move towards the individual with the best fitness.","1556-6048","","10.1109/MCI.2013.2279560","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6633027","","Satellites;Optimization;Orbits;Space vehicles;Space missions;Closed loop systems","","97","","41","IEEE","17 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

It is also one of the main reasons why software systems often lag behind hardware technologies and fail to capture the full potentials of modern day hardware infrastructure, which is mostly parallel and distributed. We need to change the way we think about software fundamentally, and make it, at its most basic level, to work like the physical world works: distributed, parallel, loosely connected, and asynchronous. KnoRBA achieves this by making the basic components of any program, such as a common word processor, to be asynchronous mobile agents. Then through provision of implementation and location transparency it establishes integration across a distributed environment. This extended abstract is an early introduction to the new revision of KnoRBA that makes it efficient in a domain like sensor networks where power and bandwidth are critical factors.","","978-1-4799-3459-1","10.1109/WF-IoT.2014.6803219","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6803219","Internet of Things;Ambient Intelligence;Distributed Software Systems;Low Energy Devices;Software Architecture;Multi-agent Systems;Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture","Servers;Computer architecture;Programming;Hardware;Computational modeling;Software systems","","1","","1","IEEE","24 Apr 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A smart control system is developed, aiming to gather machine data, both from the machine controller and the external sensors, before providing them as input to the simulation tool. The outcome of the simulation is the prediction of the machine's health status, which then is used for the identification of the machine's maintenance activities.

This paper focuses on an effective plagiarism detection tool on identifying suitable intra-corpal plagiarism detection for text based assignments by comparing unigram, bigram, trigram of vector space model with cosine similarity measure. Manually evaluated, labelled dataset was tested using unigram, bigram and trigram vector. Even though trigram vector consumes comparatively more time, it shows better results with the labelled data. In addition, the selected trigram vector space model with cosine similarity measure is compared with tri-gram sequence matching technique with Jaccard measure. In the results, cosine similarity score shows slightly higher values than the other. Because, it focuses on giving more weight for terms that do not frequently exist in the dataset and cosine similarity measure using trigram technique is more preferable than the other. Therefore, we present our new tool and it could be used as an effective tool to evaluate text based electronic assignments and minimize the plagiarism among students.","2151-1810","978-1-4799-4598-6","10.1109/ICIAFS.2014.7069593","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7069593","Jaccard similarity;plagiarism;vector space model","Plagiarism;Vectors;Computational modeling;Extraterrestrial measurements;Mathematical model;Computers;Equations","","12","","24","IEEE","30 Mar 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present model oriented programming as a new paradigm to reduce the ever-present tension between model-centric and code-centric development styles. The core of this approach is to add UML abstractions such as associations and state machines directly into a high-level programming language code. In this approach, model diagrams become just another abstract view of the code. The need for reverse engineering is eliminated, since everything in the diagram is represented directly in the code. Model orientation is illustrated using Umple, a working model oriented programming platform.

To enhance the above thrust of the country many engineering education institutions started focusing on quality of the offered education in terms of numerical ability, creativity and design ability of engineers. The Course Outcomes and Programme Specific Outcomes have been designed with the above focus as a guideline.

There is an ongoing debate concerning how to approach the learning and teaching of this skill, i.e., by focusing on “design first” by means of the UML formalism or by “OO programming first”, deferring the development of UML specifications. This work presents a teaching experience and curriculum content where a “design-first” approach was used to teach Object Oriented Design, incrementally interleaved with Object Oriented Programming aimed at implementing the modeled software through laboratory activities. Working in groups allowed the students to improve communication and collaboration skills, and the use of web 2.0 technologies, such as a wiki, allowed for better course management and for the deployment of a project involving all the students. This approach was used in two year-long courses with students who had slightly different backgrounds and dispositions. Also presented are a preliminary analysis of the written examinations and laboratory exercises; an analysis of common errors and student misconceptions and a preliminary quantitative measure of the results.","2165-9567","978-1-4799-3191-0","10.1109/EDUCON.2014.6826243","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6826243","UML;Object Oriented Design;Object Oriented Programming;C#","Unified modeling language;Encoding;Object oriented modeling;Software engineering;Educational institutions;Computational modeling","","3","","22","IEEE","5 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Applying this framework, this paper suggests the creation of a workshop modeled after the Computer Clubhouse, as developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which would take advantage of the children's sometimes above-average analytic and visual abilities. Participants would produce their own video games with Scratch or other age-appropriate tool.

The course title is ECEG 301: Praxis for Engineering Design. The objectives of this course are manifold, but is primarily designed to pave the way to improved student performance in senior design projects, promote team-work and hands-on experiences, and to enhance student completion of ABET outcomes, particularly criteria (c to h). Examples of the course contents include computer aided design (Solidworks®), 3-D printing, design process elements, functional decomposition, fabrication, implementation, and simulation of photovoltaic systems. The course also aims at introducing students to crucial and current societal and environmental issues. In this paper, the results of the multiple projects are discussed. Based on anecdotal data analysis and feedback from students and faculty, the assigned projects have encouraged students' creativity and enhanced their ability to work on multidisciplinary teams.

Thus, the authors have proposed a multi-domain framework with extracted implicit vaguely supported relationships through a systematic literature review. These relationships are verified through qualitative interviews with eight (8) game-based learning experts to validate the relationships. This paper presents seven (7) implicit relationships based on game play domain and discusses their relevancy with game environment, learning theories, and subject-matter by applying interpretive hermeneutic approach of qualitative study.

Cleaning the noisy text has become an important factor for adequate development and deployment of NLP (Natural Language Processing) services such as text-to-speech and automatic translation. In this paper we introduce a channel based normalization model for cleaning the noisy texts. The normalization is based on the types of distortion such as grapheme distortion, abbreviation and phoneme distortion. The model will explore the type of distortion occurred in the noisy word and replace it by using the different channel list. Precursory evaluation shows that the channel model will normalize the noisy word to their standard peer with 96.43 % accuracy.","","978-1-4799-3759-2","10.1109/I2CT.2014.7092164","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7092164","Natural Language Processing;Machine Translation;Social Media;Text Normalization;Noisy words","Noise measurement;Hidden Markov models;Databases;Natural language processing;Standards;Computational modeling;Adaptation models","","1","","16","IEEE","23 Apr 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A meta-search engine is a kind of search tool that dynamically dispatches user query to the underlying search engines, hence providing parallel access to multiple search engines and then aggregate the results to present single consolidated result list to user. In this paper, a novel meta-search engine, MetaFusion, has been proposed. The proposed algorithm combines fuzzy AHP with genetic algorithm to get more comprehensive and optimized results. Experimental results shows that relevancy of results returned by MetaFusion is more than several existing research Metasearch engines. The precision of MetaFusion is more when compared with Dogpile and Infospace.","","978-1-5090-3251-8","10.1109/IC3.2016.7880228","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7880228","MetaFusion;Information retrieval;metasearch;search engine;MCDM;Fuzzy AHP;Genetic Algorithm","Search engines;Engines;Metasearch;Genetic algorithms;Open wireless architecture;Google;Computational modeling","","1","","21","IEEE","20 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Whatever they might offer, only a few use a systems engineering approach. Generally, they do not formalize the environment or interactions within it. The present study proposes a new formalism for modelling the creativity process through the design of a Creative Support System (CSS). This formalism attempts to model an Innovation Challenge and is inspired by actual system engineering modelling formalisms and the literature on creativity. The first section will discuss CSS support of the “48h to Generate Ideas®” creativity challenge. Following this, the new representation formalism will be discussed. The conclusion will focus on the application of this formalism and establishment of the basis for future research.","","978-1-4799-6270-9","10.1109/IDAM.2014.6912691","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912691","Creativity Process;Creativity Support System;Creative Problem Solving;Process Model","Unified modeling language;Cascading style sheets;Adaptation models;Context;Problem-solving;Computational modeling","","1","","18","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The P-N diode is the most basic semiconductor device, but research has shown that its non-linear behavior poses problems to the students who struggle to explain its micro-scale behavior. Research in educational technologies for semiconductor materials and devices has shown improved learning with computer simulations. Freely available educational simulations that include the P-N junction show how the depletion width, the internal electric field, and band diagram changes with applied voltage. However, these diagrams are not directly used to visualize the different current components at the micro-scale. This work-in-progress paper discusses the initial design of an educational simulation of a P-N junction diode showing how the different current components vary dynamically with the applied voltage. The proposed simulation fills a void in the instructional materials related to the P-N diode by allowing students to visualize the impact that the applied voltage has on device current and determine its non-linear behavior.","2165-9567","978-1-5090-5467-1","10.1109/EDUCON.2017.7942817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7942817","Simulation;Electrical Engineering;Semiconductor;Diode","Semiconductor diodes;Current density;Charge carrier density;Computational modeling;Doping;Visualization;Semiconductor process modeling","","","","8","IEEE","8 Jun 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, at the same time, many threats have arisen as a result of the misuse of this technology. Cyber attacks could emerge as a major threat to the digital transformation of Bangladesh, given the vulnerability in web applications caused by careless coding during the development of such applications. During our review, we observed that the existence of Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the web applications of Bangladesh was very critical. This paper explores in detail the harmful web application vulnerability attack, Local File Inclusion (LFI) based on Remote File Inclusion (RFI) as well as Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi), and their impact on the applications of Bangladesh.","","978-1-5090-5769-6","10.1109/IWCI.2016.7860332","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7860332","Web Application Vulnerability;RFI and SQLi based Local File Inclusion (LFI);Remote File Inclusion (RFI)","Decision support systems;Handheld computers;Global Positioning System;Conferences;Computational intelligence;Erbium","","9","","14","IEEE","23 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We have developed a versatile participatory simulation environment as an active learning environment for the university classroom. We apply a multiagent-based approach to represent the uncertainty of the business environment.

Yes, it's the human brain, and not the human, which is the most valuable creation of God. But the brain, all its knowledge and power are destroyed after the death of man. Is it possible to model a brain and upload the contents of the real natural brain into it thereby propagating life even after death? Yes, indeed. Today, organ donation is giving a new lease of life to many ailing patients, however can brain be added to the list of organs that can be donated? Imagine the marvels that would be back into existence if we could replicate and restore the brains of geniuses like Sir Albert Einstein or Newton or even our great leaders of the past like Mahatma Gandhi. This paper presents a literature survey on the Blue Brain technology that promptly answers all these sparkling questions. Scientists today are in research to take artificial intelligence to a level beyond everything, to create a virtual brain that could think, react, make decisions and also keep everything in some form of memory to do everything that a normal human brain can. To achieve this, the main approach is to upload an actual brain in a virtual brain. So that even after death the person's conscience would be able to function exactly as a normal brain in the form of a machine. IBM along with scientists at BMI (Brain and Mind Institute) École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) Research University in Switzerland are simulating the brain's biological systems into a 3D model, which would recreate the electrochemical interactions that take place inside the brain. If this simulation results in a success, the modeling would extend to different parts of the brain and make it function with all the abilities of a natural brain, thereby eliminating the chances of any brain malfunctions such as psychiatric disorders like depression and autism, which are possible in the normal brain. IBM names this project as the 'Blue Brain' project.","2472-7555","978-1-5090-0076-0","10.1109/CICN.2015.319","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7546166","nanobot;neuron;neo-cortical;reverse engineering;supercomputer;simulation","Neurons;Brain modeling;Supercomputers;Computational modeling;Data models","","1","","20","IEEE","18 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As the level of security breaches and frauds of transaction increases, it requires highly secure identification and personal verification technologies. Here user identity plays a very important role to uniquely verify or authenticate the individual person. Instead of designing more complex system, which is more expensive and which requires more software and hardware resources, it is essential to think about to bridge the gap which will create a system with simplicity, less costly and efficient, as well as socially acceptable. The factors which highly impact the face recognition system performance are illumination and pose variations. Feature extraction is the key to reach face recognition. In literature various feature extraction techniques are available. The paper presents six different techniques to generate a feature vector by calculating Centric mean and forward and backward diagonal mean and then apply DCT over it which will reduce the feature vector size and yields less computational complexity giving faster recognition. Experimental tests performed on the ORL and UMIST database achieves a recognition rate of 99 percent, with low computational cost without any pre-processing step.","","978-1-84919-859-2","10.1049/cp.2013.2615","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6950899","Face Recognition;DCT;Centric Mean;Row and Column Mean;Forward and Backward Diagonal Mean","","","","","","","10 Nov 2014","","","IET","IET Conferences"

This has forced a re-think and development of alternative energy efficiency technology. In South Africa's cold storage chain the entire refrigeration system is among the most energy-intensive areas, but also offers opportunity for short and long term saving. It also provides an opportunity for enhancement of sustainable development and cold chain management. This paper presents a combination of three efficient technologies in those areas: (1) Airflow pattern optimisation through a computer assisted simulation model in which overall energy efficiency of cooling facilities is dependent not only on the energy generation efficiency of the refrigeration system, but also utilisation efficiency of all cooling facilities. Optimal airflow pattern of a cold room would move heat effectively to a refrigeration system, hence increasing both energy efficiency and refrigeration distribution. (2) Variable speed drive (VSDs) technology on evaporator fans motors: VSDs reduce motor electricity consumption by 30-60%; other benefits include prolonging equipment life through motor speed adjustments according to load. (3) Minimising heat transmission load by heat conduction transfer - coloured and shaded external walls being a major factor. Such technologies saved energy, thus reducing cold chain facilities' demand. The system was also cost-efficient and, inter-alia, research detailed in this paper contributed towards alleviating South Africa's energy problems.","2166-059X","978-0-9814311-8-5","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6330161","","Energy consumption;Energy efficiency;Fans;Atmospheric modeling;Computational modeling;Resistance","","1","","9","","15 Oct 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many of these challenges stem from the fact that technologies are continually experiencing dramatic change, and savvy customers are increasingly demanding more qualified services. Although research and experiential findings on services in many disciplines have achieved impressive results, systematic research on modern services systems is rarely considered. Aiming at services systems (not only services themselves), this paper discusses the contributions and the potentials for the field of systems theory for Services Science, Management and Engineering (SSME). Thus, SSME can provide suitable referential clues for discussing impacts of systems theory on services research, and systemic thinking can be applied to discuss key issues in SSME. Providing basic definitions of services and services systems, this paper elaborates on the research objects and methodologies of SSME from systems perspective, and proposes that systems theory can be applied as the foundations of services engineering. This paper further sheds light on systemic issues in services science and engineering, services operations, and services systems management. It also provides a summary of relevant theories and tools applied to services systems at the systems level. Finally, some potential prospects in SSME research are presented to meet research demands and practical challenges.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2013.2260622","Harbin Institute of Technology (Weihai)(grant numbers:IDGA 10001002); Shandong Social Science Planning(grant numbers:12DGLJ13); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6519937","Services engineering;services management;services science;services system;SSME;systems theory;Services engineering;services management;services science;services system;SSME;systems theory","Production;Manufacturing;Industries;Economics;Standards organizations;Organizations","","10","","218","IEEE","24 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A subject sitting in the virtual environment controls the main character of a virtual reality game: a penguin that slides down a snowy mountain slope. While the subject can trigger a jump action via the BCI, additional steering with a game controller as a secondary task was tested. Our experiment profits from the game as an attractive task where the subject is motivated to get a higher score with a better BCI performance. A BCI based on the so-called brain switch was applied, which allows discrete asynchronous actions. Fourteen subjects participated, of which 50% achieved the required performance to test the penguin game. Comparing the BCI performance during the training and the game showed that a transfer of skills is possible, in spite of the changes in visual complexity and task demand. Finally and most importantly, our results showed that the use of a secondary motor task, in our case the joystick control, did not deteriorate the BCI performance during the game. Through these findings, we conclude that our chosen approach is a suitable multimodal or hybrid BCI implementation, in which the user can even perform other tasks in parallel.","1943-0698","","10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2242072","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6418003","Brain–computer interfaces (BCI);brain switch;game;hybrid BCI;multimodal;multitasking;virtual reality (VR)","Games;Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Training;Brain computer interfaces;Educational institutions;Feature extraction","","69","","51","IEEE","23 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, despite its initial purpose of serving as a global prior for entire signals, it has been commonly used for modeling low dimensional patches due to the computational constraints it entails when deployed with learned dictionaries. A way around this problem has been recently proposed, adopting a convolutional sparse representation model. This approach assumes that the global dictionary is a concatenation of banded circulant matrices. While several works have presented algorithmic solutions to the global pursuit problem under this new model, very few truly effective guarantees are known for the success of such methods. In this paper, we address the theoretical aspects of the convolutional sparse model providing the first meaningful answers to questions of uniqueness of solutions and success of pursuit algorithms, both greedy and convex relaxations, in ideal and noisy regimes. To this end, we generalize mathematical quantities, such as the l0 norm, mutual coherence, Spark and restricted isometry property to their counterparts in the convolutional setting, intrinsically capturing local measures of the global model. On the algorithmic side, we demonstrate how to solve the global pursuit problem by using simple local processing, thus offering a first of its kind bridge between global modeling of signals and their patch-based local treatment.","1941-0476","","10.1109/TSP.2017.2733447","European Research Council under EU's seventh Framework Program(grant numbers:320649); Israel Science Foundation(grant numbers:1770/14); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7997798","Sparse representations;convolutional sparse coding;uniqueness guarantees;stability guarantees;orthogonal matching pursuit;basis pursuit;global modeling;local processing","Dictionaries;Convolution;Convolutional codes;Computational modeling;Sparse matrices;Mathematical model;Matching pursuit algorithms","","77","","48","IEEE","31 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This architecture creates two different actors: (i) conceptual designers and Database Administrators (DBA). The first actor collects user requirements, chooses the relevant diagrams for designing the conceptual model (or the logical model). The DBA ensures the performance, the maintenance and the tuning of the final application. Most of the tasks performed by these two actors are complex and time consuming for a majority of companies. Recently, some academic and industry research efforts are moving towards truly zero-administration of DW by proposing tools (advisors) substituting some tasks of DBA. One of the functionalities of these tools is to propose recommendations in choosing optimization structures such as indexing, materialized views, etc. They do not guarantee robust solutions. In this paper, we propose a revolutionary economical model for DB /DW application. Instead of substituting the DBA by advisors, we propose to delegate some DBA tasks to conceptual designers like selecting optimization structures. First, we propose to connect user requirements to the conceptual model of the target application. Secondly, based on the analysis of requirements, SQL queries are identified and then used to select optimization structures. Finally, a feasibility of our approach is tested through the selection of bitmap join indexes based on user requirements.","","978-0-7695-4914-9","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6417279","Requirements Engineering;ANSI/SPARC Ar-chitecture;Designer;Administrator;Data Warehouse;Optimization;Experiments","Optimization;Indexes;Unified modeling language;Data models;Benchmark testing;Amplitude modulation","","4","","12","IEEE","24 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To do so, it is suitable to use both TeX and Computer Algebra System (CAS). Nevertheless, the graphic output of CAS is not suited to the TeX document of the material. To improve it, since 2006, the authors have been developing KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS. The use of both TeX and KETpic based on CAS enables teachers to produce their original class materials with accurate and impressive figures. They wish not only to produce their original class materials with figures but also to use the class materials with figures produced by the others. To realize that objective, a good KETpic programming style is needed. For example, when educators produce a figure along with their material by KETpic, they wish to perform symbolic thinking, i.e. they create a KETpic program in a mathematical drawing procedure and concentrate their energy on qualitative improvement of the figures while they recognize the global image of the figure. Symbolic thinking is a factor in good elements of KETpic programming style. The authors investigated other good elements of KETpic programming style using a documentation approach, which is the method of checking teachers' records in detail for their improvement.

Drawing on existing concepts and research methods this study applies a case study approach with mixed methods to investigate students' development of team-attitudes and characteristics of team cooperation. It turned out, that students identified the quality of cooperation in their teams as beneficial and productive while from an outside point of view their teamwork seemed to be unorganized and not cooperative. These contradicting results were clarified in a classroom meeting, where it became clear, that the student-centered classroom climate still could have influenced students' team attitudes in a way that students felt comfortable to express themselves in their, sometimes not so nice, youth language during problem solving tasks but while be able to solve problems effectively.","2165-9567","978-1-4673-8633-3","10.1109/EDUCON.2016.7474667","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7474667","computational thinking;student-centered learning;mixed research methods;computer science education;team attitudes","Problem-solving;Teamwork;Meteorology;Instruments;Encoding;Reflection;Organizations","","9","","38","IEEE","23 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Drawing on contemporary criminological models, we present a theoretical rationale for revising the SKRAM model. The revised model suggests that in addition to the classical SKRAM components, both individual attributes and certain offline and online circumstances fuel cyber attackers' motivation to offend, and increase the probability that a cyber-attack will be launched against an organization. Consistent with our proposed model, and its potential in predicting the occurrence of different types of cyber-dependent crimes against organizations, we propose that Information Technology professionals' efforts to facilitate safe computing environments should design new approaches for collecting indicators regarding attackers' potential threat, and predicting the occurrence and timing of cyber-dependent crimes.","","978-1-5386-1956-8","10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.50","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328393","Hackers;Cyber-Dependent Crime","Organizations;Computer hacking;Strain;Computers;Tools;Computational modeling","","3","","61","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study explores how the creation of UML models can be understood to consist of different cognitive activities: (i) designing: thinking about the design (ideation, key-design decision making), (ii) notation expression: expressing a design in a modeling notation and (iii) layouting: the spatial organization of model elements in a diagram. We explain that these different subactivities relate to different short-term and long-term benefits of modeling. In this study we present two controlled experiments with a total of 100 subjects creating models for a small system. In these experiments we focus on software models as represented through UML class diagram. Our results show that at least 56% of the effort spent on creating a class model is actually due to designing. Notation expression is around 41% of the model creation effort and layouting is in the order of 3%. This finding suggests that a significant part of creating models is devoted to design thinking about the problem.","","978-1-5386-2141-7","10.1109/SEAA.2017.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8051376","Software Design;Software Modeling;UML;Design Effort;Modeling Effort;Layouting Effort;Empirical Software Engineering","Unified modeling language;Mathematical model;Software;Layout;Computational modeling;Tools;Software engineering","","6","","21","IEEE","28 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The program, App Inventor, simplifies the process of coding, making it an ideal method of teaching beginners the basics of computer programming and computational thinking practice. The simplicity of the program is evident through the rapid learning process of the high schoolers, who were mostly beginners at coding. Additionally, during the process of teaching and helping the middle schooler's debugging session, the high school students were able to properly digest the principles and fundamentals of computer programming by revisiting and teaching what they learned. The students, both the high schoolers and middle schoolers, collaborated in exploring and experimenting with multiple variations of apps that could be made with the given teaching materials.

We present a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM) denotative model to describe how the factors of individual emotions and cognition influence each other. We adjust the weight matrix of causal relationships between these factors by using a so-called nonlinear Hebbian learning method. Based on this FCM model, we can implement individual decision rules against possible infections for disease propagation studies. We take the simulation of influenza A [H1N1] spreading on a campus as an example.

Students continue to face several difficulties when learning programming [1] and the lack of efficient tools to overcome such difficulties can affect the students' motivation [2]. Over time, this creates a drastic and negative impact in their attitude towards `learning programming,' which is undesirable for student success in engineering education. To rectify this, a suitable approach that can motivate students needs to be developed to change students' mindset towards learning programming. Student motivation is considered imperative as it is directly influences a student's perseverance and dedication towards accomplishing an objective [3]. Rather than viewing programming courses as a means to complete coursework requirements, students should be made to realize the `power of programming.' Learning and gaining experience in computer programming necessarily involves the development of computational/critical thinking and problem solving skills. All these skills sharpen the minds of the students while simultaneously opening up multiple job prospects for them upon graduation. To this end, to facilitate interactive and fun-filled learning, this research employs a learner-centric, user-friendly Virtual Environment (VE) to teach programming concepts.

The fact that human simulation is possible drives home the presence of formal patterns in a host of phenomena that for a long time were thought to be inimical to mathematical analysis. That implies a double pedagogical challenge: teaching humanities students to recognize formal structures in the phenomena they study (counter-intuitive for them), and teaching M&S students to collaborate with humanities people who think very differently (equally counter-intuitive). The three perspectives presented here underline the usefulness of human simulation, as well as the difficulties and benefits associated with teaching and learning human simulation.","1558-4305","978-1-5386-3428-8","10.1109/WSC.2017.8248136","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8248136","","Iron;Reflection;Complexity theory;History","","2","","16","IEEE","8 Jan 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, MAS research generally lacks an adequate understanding of modern distributed computing. In this Blue Sky paper, we envision decentralized multiagent systems as a way to place decentralized intelligence in distributed computing, specifically, by supporting computation at the level of social meanings. We motivate our proposals for research in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), which has become a major thrust in distributed computing. From the IoT's representative applications, we abstract out the major challenges of relevance to decentralized intelligence. These include the heterogeneity of IoT components; asynchronous and delay-tolerant communication and decoupled enactment; and multiple stakeholders with subtle requirements for governance, incorporating resource usage, cooperation, and privacy. The IoT yields high-impact problems that require solutions that go beyond traditional ways of thinking.

They need to solve the data problem in a different way, through the implementation of an effective Data Governance. Data Governance needs to take a policy-centric approach to data models, data quality standards, data security and lifecycle management, and processes for defining, implementing and enforcing these policies. Until recently, data governance has largely been informal, in siloes around specific enterprise repositories, lacking structure and the wider support of the organization. In many government departments, data governance exists as a set of very ambiguous and generic regulations. The area of data governance is still under-researched, despite its importance. With the emergence of Cloud computing, and its increased adoption by businesses, public organisations and governments, as much as the potential gains from adopting the technology, businesses face new and more complex challenges. Such emphasize the need for effective data governance strategy and programs, which can ensure best returns for cloud adoption.

Students participating in the program gain experience in the application of highperformance computing to real-world problems in science, mathematics, and engineering through a year-long internship. By engaging undergraduate and graduate students in Petascale computing research and development projects, students build confidence and competence in PDC and HPC.The BWSIP recruited a large and diverse applicant pool from across the US from which 21 research interns reflecting that diversity were selected and each matched with a mentor and a project for the year-long internship. Students, many having only introductory programming experience, began their internship by attending the two-week Petascale Institute -- each day including 6.5 hours of directed, inquiry-based learning and 2 hours of open lab using the run-modify-write paradigm -- during which they were trained in PDC and HPC tools, techniques, and technologies using Blue Waters at NCSA, and by analogy other XSEDE HPC resources. Students then continued working all summer on their home campuses, or were hosted by their mentor, with on-going work expected to be continued during both Fall and Spring semesters.The project engaged an external evaluator to conduct formative and summative assessments of the program. BWSIP Interns participated in pre- and post-surveys, daily reflections/evaluation questions, as well as in a focus group during their training. Even with significant differences in background, knowledge, and with varying projects, participants stated that the two-week institute was an essential element to help them learn conceptual thinking and how to program using parallel computing.

We then use our model to craft and add innovative lab assignments to “Digital Systems”, which is a core course taken by Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering and Computer Science students worldwide. In each lab assignment, students are provided with some components or puzzle pieces as well as the user guide of a digital system, and possibly some reading materials to better understand the operation theory of the system. One selling point of our model is its significant flexibility, so that the game may be played in different ways. Here is one example: students go over the user guide and the reading materials to get a solid understating of the underlying digital system.

Then students challenge themselves to complete the puzzle and eventually build the digital system physically and test it.

They can help us classify newly encountered objects on the basis of our past experiences. But how can we get the concepts? As visual information account for about 80% of total perceptual information, this paper proposes a concept acquisition method based on visual cognition. Firstly, we give a new definition of concept based on the classic views. Then, we imitate the process of visual cognition to get the approximate locations of the salient proto-objects. By using the improved cerebral cortex learning algorithm, the concepts of the objects can be acquired. However, the whole model also has top-down process. The concepts learned in turn affect the former saliency-based region selection method. We demonstrate that the suggested method can not only yield dynamic and phase-smooth concepts, but also recognize objects with good precise. Our findings will facilitate further studies on human thinking.","","978-1-4799-6732-2","10.1109/MFI.2014.6997634","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6997634","Concept;Object recognition;Visual perception;Cognition","Visualization;Image color analysis;Prototypes;Brain modeling;Cognition;Educational institutions;Computational modeling","","","","41","IEEE","29 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

One might systematically evaluate a known space of possible solutions until the right one is found. Alternatively, it may prove necessary to enlarge or restructure the expected problem space - so called “thinking outside the box.” This approach can yield an experience of unexpected insight or feeling of Aha!. Current challenges to understanding this phenomenon from a neurocognitive perspective include the vast diversity of problem domains and time scales for solutions. Whereas the subjective suddenness of an “Aha!” moment may lead to the impression that insight must be precipitated by a set of discrete, short-lived neural events, this report outlines research revealing that even before a problem is presented, scalp-recorded measures of resting or baseline brain states are linked with future performance and likelihood of experiencing insight during the search for a solution. Additionally, this study also shows that compared to more systematic problem solving approaches, insight is accompanied by differences in cortical and likely cognitive engagement that are detectable throughout much of the problem solving phase, rather than being confined to a distinct interval immediately preceding the dawn of a solution. These findings are important for the development of therapies targeting problem solving and reasoning skills, such as those used in cognitive training interventions to mitigate the effects of cognitive decline.","1558-4615","978-1-4244-7929-0","10.1109/EMBC.2014.6944860","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6944860","","","Behavior;Brain;Brain Mapping;Cognition Disorders;Creativity;Electroencephalography;Humans;Mathematics;Neurons;Problem Solving;Rest;Software","","","21","IEEE","6 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In addition to that, walking features are calculated based on the obtained data. Some studies points out distraction of the pedestrian relates to consumption of working memory. We assume considering the relationship between consumption of working memory and walking behavior suggest the effectiveness to estimate distraction of the pedestrian. When each pedestrian is walking while consuming working memory, for example thinking about something, their walk deviates from normal. Machine Learning method, Random Forest, is applied to classify whether the pedestrian is distracted using features of walking. An experiment suggests we can distinguish walking features represent both distracted state and normal state completely. The result indicates the method can find distracted pedestrians whose working memory is highly consumed. We discuss why we can distinguish the distraction of the pedestrian from walking feature components with the variable importance. In addition, we have conducted regression analysis on the significant feature components to figure out the reasons.

This permits low barrier experimentation on the modded simulation, which is hoped to help students gain a deeper understanding of scientific phenomena that is the focus of the activity.

It was assumed that the underlying system worked in a trustworthy environment, so MR developers did not provide authentication methods in the MR model. This assumption is still valid to some extent, whereas major IT players in the world, such as Facebook and Yahoo have implemented the MR model in their private clouds. However, recently there are efforts to provide the MR model in public clouds. Inadequate authentication methods for the MR model in such environment makes the job execution work-flow vulnerable to many attacks such as impersonation and spoofing attacks.

We consider an early learner exposed to perceptual data (video) with co-occurring word-segmented commentaries. In the initial stages of an incremental statistical learning process, content words (e.g. object names) are acquired. Then, some prototypical containment categories emerge by clustering spatial relations in the perceptual input. These situational regularities are used to focus only on sentences uttered during containment situations. By using k-gram and path alignment models on this limited corpus, we show that such a system may begin to learn word categories as well as syntacto-semantic constructions such as “into the X”/[IN(tr,X)]. A key step in the process is the structure in which this perceptual knowledge is organized. The term “image schema” has often been used to refer to such structures, but has widely divergent interpretations. We view the image schema as a category oracle; initially limited to spatio-temporal situation, it may extend, with increasing exposure to language, to new situations.","2161-9476","978-1-4673-4965-9","10.1109/DevLrn.2012.6400817","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6400817","","Pragmatics;Syntactics;Containers;Semantics;Abstracts;Visualization;Computational modeling","","","","24","IEEE","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is no denying the fact that the creativity is the most important attribute of good management and it also helps to drill longitudinally and laterally sense of research and innovative ideas and conceptions and things will assume totality as and when both the sense of Arts and Science is meaningfully applied.

However, the properties of high dimensional data are often poorly understood and overlooked during the process of data modelling and analysis. Similarly, how to optimally fuse different modalities is still a big research question. In this paper, we addressed these challenges by proposing a novel two level brain-inspired compression based optimised multimodal fusion framework for emotion recognition. In the first level, the framework extracts the compressed and optimised multimodal features by applying a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based compression on each modality (i.e. audio, text, and visuals). The second level simply concatenates the extracted optimised and compressed features for classification. The performance of the proposed approach with two different compression levels (i.e. 78% and 98%) is compared with late fusion (class level-1 dimension, class probabilities level-4 dimension) and early fusion (feature level-72000 dimension). The simulation results and critical analysis have demonstrated up to 10% and 5% performance improvement as compared to the state-of-the-art support vector machine (SVM) and long-short-term memory (LSTM) based multimodal emotion recognition systems respectively. We hypothesise that there exist an optimal level of compression at which optimised multimodal features could be extracted from each modality, which could lead to a significant performance improvement.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285377","Emotion Recognition;Multimodal Fusion;Compression;Optimisation;Deep Convolutional Neural Network","Feature extraction;Convolution;Emotion recognition;Videos;Visualization;Kernel;Acoustics","","12","","12","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In general, a directed acyclic graph of tasks with their execution times (i.e., a task graph) is necessary to extract critical paths. We assume, however, that only the set of tasks, and their start and end times are known, e.g., an execution trace in the form of a Gantt chart. This information can be extracted from real machines or from the output of analysis tools, whereas extraction of the exact task graph often is problematic due to imperative modeling formalisms and complicated platform semantics (resource allocation, varying execution speeds). We show that, based on start and end times only, an over- approximation of the critical paths of an unknown task graph can be extracted nevertheless. Furthermore, this approach is generalized to deal with ""noisy"" execution traces of real machines in which control overhead is present. Finally, we discuss various methods to deal with false positives, and apply our approach to a complex industrial case study.","","978-0-7695-4914-9","10.1109/ICCSE.2012.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6417337","embedded systems;critical path analysis;task graph","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods;Engines;Schedules;Approximation algorithms;Semantics;Timing","","7","","20","IEEE","24 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ISO/IEC 15408 is a complex security standard which requires involvement of wide range of participants to perform a quite number of tasks as well as various documents. ISO/IEC 15408 is periodically reviewed and maintained to achieve ongoing improvement so that workflow of tasks and contents/format of documents related with the standard are changed according to changes of the standards. Consequently, it is difficult to do all of the tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 without any supporting tools. However, there is no study to identify which tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 can be supported by software tools. Indeed, no one makes clear what the tasks and participants exist. This paper presents the first analysis to identify all software supportable tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408. The paper enumerates all of the participants, documents, and tasks related with ISO/IEC 15408 and shows relationship among them, and identifies all software supportable tasks. The analysis and its results become a basis to construct an information security engineering environment based on ISO/IEC 15408 for ensuring the whole security of an information/software system.","","978-1-4799-2549-0","10.1109/CIS.2013.132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6746500","ISO/IEC 15408;software supportable task;information security engineering environment","ISO standards;IEC standards;Security;Certification;Software systems","","5","","11","IEEE","24 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, research on automatic composition using AI technology and especially evolutionary algorithms is blooming and has received promising results. A common issue at the current evolutionary composition systems is their requirement for subjective feedback of human sensation as evaluation criterion, which is vulnerable to the fatigue and decreased sensitivity after long-time listening. This paper proposes using music theory with the information from music charts in the evaluation criterion to address this issue. Specifically, we generate the weighted rules based on music theory for the fitness function. The weights are determined according to the download numbers from music charts. These weights obtained can interpret the music style and render an objective measure of compositions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively achieve satisfactory compositions.","","978-1-4673-6010-4","10.1109/CICAC.2013.6595222","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6595222","Evolutionary computation;automatic composition;music theory;fitness function;computational creativity;creative intelligence","Genetic algorithms;Biological cells;Bars;Sociology;Statistics;Rhythm","","16","","19","IEEE","12 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Reducing the number of repeated computations either within a program or across runs of the same program would allow analysts to build and debug trading strategies more quickly. We built a disk memoization library that caches function computations to files to avoid recomputation. Anymemoization solution should be easy to use, minimizing the need for users to think about whether caching is appropriate, while at the same time giving them control over speed, accuracy, and space used for caching. Guo and Engler proposed a similar tool that does automatic memoization by modifying the python interpreter, while the packages Jug and Joblib are distributed computing tools that have memoization options. Our library attempts to maintain the ease of use of the above packages for memoization, but at the same time give a higher degree of control of how caching is done for users who need it. We provide the same basic features as these other libraries, but allow control of how hashing is done, space usage for individual functions and all memoization, refreshing memoization for a specific function, and accuracy checking. This should lead to both increased productivity and speed increases for recomputation. We show that for several financial calculations, including Markowitz Optimization, Fama French, and the Singular Value Decomposition, memoization greatly speeds up recomputation, often by over 99%. We also show that by using xxhash, a non-cryptographic hash function, instead of md5, and avoiding equality checks, our package greatly outperforms joblib, the best current package.","","978-1-4799-7027-8","10.1109/WHPCF.2014.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7016369","computational finance; memoization; python","Libraries;Optimization;Testing;Runtime;Accuracy;Aerospace electronics;Buildings","","3","","13","IEEE","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We conducted a depiction task to instruct participants in drawing what they thought when they read fictive motion sentences and non-fictive motion sentences in Mandarin Chinese. After the drawing task, three participants that did not join the drawing task judged whether the trajectory was lengthened or not in the pictures according to their intuition. The experimental results show that trajectories depicted for the fictive motion sentences were judged significantly more lengthened than those for the non-fictive motion sentences. The findings of our study suggest even though there is no explicit movement involving in the meanings of fictive motions in Mandarin, people automatically simulate the movement and the trajectories.

Intelligence analysis is inherently a fluid activity involving transitions between mental and interaction states through analytic processes. A gap exists to complement these transitions at micro-analytic level during data exploration or task performance. We propose Behavioural markers (BMs) which are representatives of the action choices that analysts make during their analytical processes as the bridge between human cognition and computation through semantic interaction. A low level semantic action sequence computation technique has been proposed to extract these BMs from captured process log. Our proposed computational technique can supplement the problems of existing qualitative approaches to extract such BMs.","","978-1-5386-2385-5","10.1109/EISIC.2017.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8240784","Behavioural Markers;Non-Technical Skills;Insight;Imagination;Fluidity and Rigour.","Cognition;Data visualization;Semantics;Visual analytics;Tools;Creativity","","","","12","IEEE","28 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we introduce a flexible mechanism for assigning rule entries to switch tables. Accordingly, we propose a conceptual abstraction that tailors Openflow forwarding paths to the hardware switch. Our approach aims to provide an optimal mapping of entries to physical tables. Its main idea consists in using a semantic analysis to reflect the computational relation between rules and a set of packet descriptors characterized by predefined table entries.","2162-190X","978-1-4673-9265-5","10.1109/NOTERE.2015.7293507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7293507","SDN;Openflow;Lattice Theory;Compilation","Hardware;Lattices;Ports (Computers);Protocols;Routing;Semantics;Context","","","","10","IEEE","8 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The decision support model proposed here provides intelligent decisive signals similar to the fuzzy capability of human brain. Fuzzy Logic control (FLC) model is designed to recognize the events that are likely to create defects and output action signals are generated. Speed difference between conveyor rollers and rolled products, percentage of carbon content and impact force on groove rollers are the three inputs and it produces two outputs in the form of either Andon (a visual signal) or line stoppage. By using Multiple Input and Multiple Output (MIMO) autonomation system, surface defects can be prevented by monitoring level of inputs.","","978-1-4799-8579-1","10.1109/RAIT.2016.7507915","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7507915","fuzzy logic;autonomation;surface finish;MIMO system;Rolling mill","Fuzzy logic;Wires;Surface treatment;Steel;MIMO;Automation","","","","17","IEEE","9 Jul 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, the authors have critically analyzed the workflow scheduling algorithms for its pros and cons and thereby identified the research issues in workflow scheduling algorithms. The theoretical analysis of `Enhanced Max-Min' scheduling algorithm suggests that if the algorithm is applied for workflow execution in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Cloud, a higher efficiency/lower `makespan' can be achieved if the characteristics of resources are considered while scheduling workflow tasks.

Currently, neither modern commercial photogrammetric software nor state-of-the-art algorithms are able to provide a spatial distribution of uncertainty. In this letter, we explain why this is the case, despite a high demand from the user community. Many applications would indeed benefit from the availability of error bars on each point, as uncertainties on derived models and quantities could be accurately predicted. For instance, change detection could be performed rigorously since the statistical significance of observed changes could be computed. In this letter, we focus on dense stereo methods. We first explain that it is not possible to derive reliable predictive uncertainties mainly due to matching and modeling errors. Our research shows that both intrinsic and practical limitations of the algorithms lead to unpredictable artifacts. Then, we focus on the use of empirical errors, showing that, despite the redundancy brought by multiview stereo, there is a fundamental limitation due to the unknown density of independent measurements. We think that these problems will represent a big challenge for the future, as these limitations cannot be addressed by algorithmic design, computational power, or imaging sensor technology.","1558-0571","","10.1109/LGRS.2014.2373133","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6985602","Error analysis;image matching;image processing;point clouds;probability;spatial quality;uncertainty;Error analysis;image matching;image processing;point clouds;probability;spatial quality;uncertainty","Uncertainty;Three-dimensional displays;Noise;Computational modeling;Correlation;Radiometry;Data models","","3","","26","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The effective dielectric constant of the soil/water/air mixture is dependent on the soil's dry density and moisture content. Both TDR and FDR methods are performed on a coaxial transmission line filled with a soil/water/air mixture. The flow of the water through the soil creates a dynamic situation in which the soil/water/air electrical impedance changes over time. The resulting soil has heterogeneous water content, creating varying electrical impedance values along the length of the coaxial line. The soil compaction, i.e., dense or loose, has significant impact on the heterogeneity of the moisture content through the soil and the dry density of the soil. In each case, the effective dielectric constant is determined from the data collected from TDR and FDR experiments, and the values are compared with the predictions using established empirical models by Topp, Hilhorst, and Hendrickx. With the exception of the data represented as a function of the degree of saturation, the Hendrickx model appears to best represent the measured dielectric constants since it falls within two standard deviations of the measured data. A computer simulation technology (CST) Microwave Studio is used to supplement experimental observations of various soil moisture contents in a coaxial cell. Simulations confirm that the change in the dielectric constant through the soil is a result of the heterogeneous moisture distribution. It was found that the soil moisture content has a major impact on the resulting dielectric constant from measurements or modeling. In the coaxial-cell device, soil moisture migration during the testing period results in a heterogeneous moisture regime and a temporal dielectric constant. This is particularly exaggerated for high-hydraulic-conductivity soils such as sand.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.2012.2205588","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6252064","Dielectric constant;FDR;hendrickx model;hilhorst model;modeling;soil;soil moisture;TDR;Topp model","Soil;Moisture;Soil measurements;Computational modeling;Dielectric constant;Atmospheric modeling;Dielectric measurements","","19","","8","IEEE","27 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blended learning approaches have the potential to reduce this barrier by facilitating the distribution of expertise across distances. In this poster we present our approach to understanding how to design blended learning models for the informal space that take advantage of the expertise of adult mentors and computer science experts. Our theoretical framing is based on Nacu et al. (2014) adult mentor roles, which suggest that adults play different roles (e.g., encourager, monitor, broker) to support students learning. We use Minecraft, a popular, 3D, online, multiplayer game, as our study context. The poster presents two studies that investigate ways of facilitating mentorship in a blended learning environment to teach computational thinking. Study 1 focuses on documenting the roles mentors play while facilitating a computer science-related Minecraft workshop with middle school students. Study 2 focuses on understanding how these roles are modified when online and in person mentors work together to facilitate a computational learning opportunity. Our initial findings suggest that defining a scalable model to support blended learning models in informal spaces requires a variety of mentor roles. Additionally, when coordinating mentorship across mediums, gaps in student support can arise when there is a lack of (a) explicit strategies of communication in place between in-person and online mentors; and (b) clearly defined roles assigned to mentors.","","978-1-5090-3419-2","10.1109/RESPECT.2016.7836181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836181","","Computer science;Computational modeling;Media;Electronic mail;Monitoring;Three-dimensional displays;Games","","","","","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We pose the question: Can we automate the entirely manual and elaborate process of GIF creation by leveraging the plethora of user generated GIF content? We propose a Robust Deep RankNet that, given a video, generates a ranked list of its segments according to their suitability as GIF. We train our model to learn what visual content is often selected for GIFs by using over 100K user generated GIFs and their corresponding video sources. We effectively deal with the noisy web data by proposing a novel adaptive Huber loss in the ranking formulation. We show that our approach is robust to outliers and picks up several patterns that are frequently present in popular animated GIFs.

Upon receiving a query, the goal is to report every ""heavy hitter"" i ∈ [n] with |xi| ≥ ε ∥x∥p as part of a list L ⊆ [n] of size O(1/εp), i.e. proportional to the maximum possible number of heavy hitters. For any pε(0,2] the COUNTSKETCH of [CCFC04] solves ℓp heavy hitters using O(ε-p lg n) words of space with O(lg n) update time, O(n lg n) query time to output L, and whose output after any query is correct with high probability (whp) 1 - 1/poly(n) [JST11, Section 4.4]. This space bound is optimal even in the strict turnstile model [JST11] in which it is promised that xi ≥ 0 for all i ∈ [n] at all points in the stream, but unfortunately the query time is very slow. To remedy this, the work [CM05] proposed the ""dyadic trick"" for the COUNTMIN sketch for p = 1 in the strict turnstile model, which to maintain whp correctness achieves suboptimal space O(ε-1lg2 n), worse update time O(lg2 n), but much better query time O(ε-1poly(lg n)). An extension to all p ∈ (0,2] appears in [KNPW11, Theorem 1], and can be obtained from [Pag13]. We show that this tradeoff between space and update time versus query time is unnecessary. We provide a new algorithm, EXPANDERSKETCH, which in the most general turnstile model achieves optimal O(ε-plog n) space, O(log n) update time, and fast O(ε-ppoly(log n)) query time, providing correctness whp. In fact, a simpler version of our algorithm for p = 1 in the strict turnstile model answers queries even faster than the ""dyadic trick"" by roughly a log n factor, dominating it in all regards. Our main innovation is an efficient reduction from the heavy hitters to a clustering problem in which each heavy hitter is encoded as some form of noisy spectral cluster in a much bigger graph, and the goal is to identify every cluster. Since every heavy hitter must be found, correctness requires that every cluster be found. We thus need a ""cluster-preserving clustering"" algorithm, that partitions the graph into clusters with the promise of not destroying any original cluster. To do this we first apply standard spectral graph partitioning, and then we use some novel combinatorial techniques to modify the cuts obtained so as to make sure that the original clusters are sufficiently preserved. Our cluster-preserving clustering may be of broader interest much beyond heavy hitters.","0272-5428","978-1-5090-3933-3","10.1109/FOCS.2016.16","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7782918","heavy hitters;streaming;clustering","Clustering algorithms;Computational modeling;Partitioning algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Complexity theory;Estimation","","30","","54","IEEE","15 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the huge design space, it is hard to determine the optimal configuration of microarchitecture parameters to satisfy the target performance and power requirements within limited time at the early stage of processor design. In this paper, a Critical Path Analysis directed Design Space Exploration (CPADSE) methodology for design space exploration of microprocessors is proposed. In CPADSE, a dependence graph model is constructed using the profile information generated during the program simulation. Then the critical paths of the dependence graph model are computed and patterns of the critical path are identified. The microarchitecture parameters mostly affecting processor`s performance or other metrics can be identified using the Plackett-Burman design method, which is always referenced as sensitivity analysis. Then the result of critical path analysis and sensitivity analysis is further used to guide the selection of search direction in both SA-CPADSE and TB-CPADSE design space search algorithms, which are proposed in this paper. Experiment result shows that for the design space exploration on SPEC 2000 benchmarks, SA-CPADSE obtains 2x speedup over baseline design space exploration algorithm SA-DSE. Additionally, TB-CPADSE on average obtains 4.3x speedup over SA-CPADSE and 7x speedup over SA-DSE. At the end of this paper, we have a detailed discussion about how to extend CPADSE methodology to design space exploration of multicore processors.","","978-1-4799-8670-5","10.1109/MCSoC.2015.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7328184","Design Space Exploration;Critical Path Analysis;Microprocessor","Algorithm design and analysis;Microarchitecture;Space exploration;Computational modeling;Sensitivity analysis;Benchmark testing;Design methodology","","6","","32","IEEE","12 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The major challenge in using low resolution EEG device lies in signal analysis with reduced number of channels. In this paper, we present the signature of EEG signals for such low cost devices using three basic tasks namely, number matching; finding characters in text; finding hidden patterns and figures. These tasks map with understand, remember and analyze sub categories of Bloom's taxonomy. Different brain regions are activated while performing the above tasks. However, the EEG signals observed on the scalp are the manifestation of the combined effects of various brain regions. The cleaned EEG signals are analyzed using unsupervised clustering of features obtained from different frequency bands.

We explore the connections between modeling and coding, and stress the importance of model literacy for all.","1558-4305","978-1-4799-7486-3","10.1109/WSC.2014.7020121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7020121","","Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Educational institutions;Medical services;Robot sensing systems;Games;Computers","","4","","23","IEEE","26 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper then presents a novel layered authentication solution for the MR model and describes the core components of this solution, which includes the virtual domain based authentication framework (VDAF). These novel ideas are significant, because, first, the approach embeds the characteristics of MR-in-cloud deployments into security solution designs, and this will allow the MR model be delivered as a software as a service in a public cloud environment along with our proposed authentication solution; second, VDAF supports the authentication of every interactions by any MR components involved in a job execution flow, so long as the interactions are for accessing resources of the job; third, this continuous authentication service is provided in such a manner that the costs incurred in providing the authentication service should be as low as possible.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2558456","Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research of Libya; National Oil Corporation Libya (NOC-Libya); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7460118","MapReduce;Authentication for MapReduce;Cloud Computing Security;Security Requirements;Security Threats;MapReduce;authentication for mapreduce;cloud computing security;security requirements;security threats","Authentication;Analytical models;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Scalability;Paralllel processing","","3","","24","CCBY","27 Apr 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In object-oriented systems design, modeling is the fundamental first phase that focuses on identifying core concepts and their relations. How to properly support modeling is still an open problem, and existing approaches and tools can be very different in nature. On the one hand, lightweight ones, such as pen & paper/whiteboard or CRC cards, are informal and support well the creative aspects of modeling, but produce artifacts that are difficult to store, process and reuse as documentation. On the other hand, more constrained and semi-formal ones, like UML, produce storable and processable structured artifacts with defined semantics, but this comes at the expense of creativity. We believe there exists a middle ground to investigate that maximizes the good of both worlds, that is, by supporting software modeling closer to its essence, with minimal constraints on the developer's creativity and still producing reusable structured artifacts. We also claim that modeling can be best treated by using the emerging technology of touch-based tablets. We present a novel gesture-based modeling approach based on a minimal set of constructs, and CEL, an iPad application, for rapidly creating, manipulating, and storing language agnostic object-oriented software models, which can be exported as skeleton source code in any language of choice.

To collect full paths efficiently, we introduce path pruning that reduces permanent space requirements from a trace (proportional to ranks and MPI events) to path length (the minimum). To make space requirements independent of ranks and events – even a small constant in practice – we profile program paths. Avoiding the limitations of prior path profiling approaches, we dynamically discover tasks and attribute costs in high resolution. We evaluate our algorithms on seven applications scaled up to 7000 MPI ranks. Full program paths use as little as 0.01% the permanent space of current methods; profiles require a nearly constant 100–1000KB.

This model is based on organizing the complex modeling activity into three clearly defined simpler sub-activities: 1) point-based animation, which enables a wide variety of possible temporal phenomena; 2) topological-based modeling, which makes it possible to manage a wide variety of shape-independent topologies and topological transformations; 3) free, non predetermined, association between both, and 4) final output of an animated geometrical model exhibiting any complex behavior. We experimented the proposed method by modeling tearing effects on deformable garments, on rifts and crack effects on 3D objects, and finally by modeling imaginary and paradoxical topological transformations associated with realistic Physics-based animation. Besides improving the consistency and the robustness of the modeling process of such complex phenomena, our aim is also to offer a user-centered programming environment to the Computer Graphics and Animation programmers and designers, to enlarge their modeling and experimentation abilities, and to stimulate their creativity.","","978-9-8975-8078-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7296069","Computer Animation;Topological Transformations;Particle-based Animation;Combinatorial Maps;Fractures","Animation;Computational modeling;Deformable models;Solid modeling;Shape;Adaptation models;Topology","","","","27","","12 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Biological systems address this issue with four strategies: (1) a repertoire of already computed responses tied to a situation recognition process, (2) organized in a response-time hierarchy that allows a quick response to occur immediately, and one or more slower and more deliberate responses to begin at the same time, with (3) decision processes that allow one of them to take over after a little while, or that (4) merge several of them in a combined and possibly novel response. In this paper, we describe an approach to building self-adaptive computing systems that incorporates these strategies, to cope with their intended use in hazardous, remote, unknown, or otherwise difficult environments, in which it is known a priori that the system cannot keep up with all important events, and that “as fast as possible” is not appropriate for some interactions. The key to implementing these strategies is an abstraction/refinement hierarchy of behavioral models and processes at multiple levels of granularity and precision. The key to coordinating these different models is the collection of integrative mappings among them, which are developed along with the models, and used for managing system behavior. We also describe the system development process that we use to build such systems, which differs from conventional methods by taking the basic artifacts of development, considered as partial models of aspects of the system in its environment, and retains them all in a model hierarchy, which eventually becomes the definition of the run time system. We show how to implement such systems, explain why we think they are good candidates for real-time operational environments, and illustrate the method with an example implementation.","2375-5261","978-1-4799-2111-9","10.1109/ISORC.2013.6913234","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6913234","Self-Adaptive Systems;Real-Time Systems;Biological Principles;Computational Reflection;Wrapping Infrastructure;Scenario-Based Engineering Process;Self-Modeling Systems","Wrapping;Computational modeling;Context;Program processors;Real-time systems;Analytical models;Context modeling","","4","","46","IEEE","2 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the case of bisymmetric aggregation operators with the neutral elements, Saminger, Mesiar, and Dubois, have already reduced characterization of commuting n-ary operators to resolving the unary distributive functional equations, but only some sufficient conditions of unary functions distributive over two particular classes of uninorms are given out. Indeed, it is very difficult to get the full characterizations of these equations because they are bound up with the famous Cauchy functional equation, which has so far not been completely solved. Along this way of thinking, in this paper, we will respectively investigate and fully characterize the following two functional equations f(U(x,y))=S(f(x), f(y)) and f(S(x,y))=U(f(x),f(y)), where f:[0,1]→ [0,1] is an unknown function, U is a representable uninorm, and S is a continuous t-conorm. These results are an important step toward obtaining complete characterization of the other unary distributive functional equations previously mentioned. Our results show that commuting is suitable for only the second equation but not for the first one. This is because solutions of the first equation are all piecewise constant functions, while those of the second equation are formulas with parameters. In addition, the two equations both have nonmonotone solutions completely different from those ones obtained.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2014.2307896","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61165014,11161023); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6747336","Cauchy functional equations;commuting;fuzzy connectives;representable uninorms;T-conorms","Equations;Additives;Generators;Merging;Joints;Probability distribution;Indexes","","9","","38","IEEE","24 Feb 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We introduce the notion of rectangle overlay complexity of a function f. This is a natural combinatorial complexity measure in terms of combinatorial rectangles in the communication matrix of f. Furthermore, we consider memory less and limited-memory communication models, originally introduced in Brody, Chen, Papakonstantinou, Song, and Sun with slightly different terminology. In these communication models there are two parameters of interest: The maximum message length s (which we think of as space) and the number of memory states w. Specifically, these are one-way protocols which proceed in rounds. In each round, Alice sends a message of at most s bits to Bob, receiving a message from Alice, Bob has to decide on the spot whether to output 0 or 1, or to continue the protocol. If he decides to continue, he immediately forgets Alice's message. In memory less protocols, no memory is transferred between different rounds (but Bob still has ""space"" to hold Alice's messages within each round). We can make Bob more powerful by giving him w memory states. He can change into a new state at the end of each round. We show that rectangle overlays completely characterize memory less protocols. Then, we go on to show several connections to the communication complexity polynomial hierarchy defined by Babai, Frankl and Simon in 1986. This hierarchy has recently regained attention because its connection to the algebrization barrier in complexity theory (Aaronson and Wigderson, 2009). We show that P^NP^cc is completely characterized by memory less protocols with polylog(n) space (maximum message length), and thus it admits a purely combinatorial characterization in terms of rectangle overlays. If Bob has 3 memory states and Alice sends messages of length polylog(n), they can compute every level of Sigma_k in the communication complexity hierarchy (for constant k), and also every function in AC0. Furthermore, we show that with 5 memory states and messages of length polylog(n) they can compute exactly the functions in the communication class PSPACE^cc. This gives the first meaningful characterization of PSPACE^cc in terms of space, originally defined in Babai, Frankl, and Simon without any notion of space. We also study equivalences and separations between our limited memory communication model and branching programs, and relations to circuit classes.","1093-0159","978-1-4799-3626-7","10.1109/CCC.2014.37","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6875498","Communication Complexity;Space;Polynomial Hierarchy;Combinatorial Characterization","Protocols;Complexity theory;Polynomials;Integrated circuit modeling;Computational modeling;Boolean functions;Image color analysis","","7","","24","IEEE","14 Aug 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Loosely-coupled associative computing techniques, which have so far not been considered, can provide the break-through needed for a distributed data management scheme. Using a novel lightweight associative memory algorithm known as Edge Detecting Hierarchical Graph Neuron (Edge HGN), data retrieval/processing can be modeled as a pattern recognition problem, conducted across multiple records within a single-cycle, utilizing a parallel approach.

Following the state-of-the-art in control theory, the focus in such design is restricted to ensuring the stability of the designed controllers and meeting control performance objectives, such as settling time or peak overshoot. However, automotive platforms are highly cost-sensitive and the issue of designing “resource-efficient” controllers has largely been ignored so far and is addressed using very ad hoc techniques.

Innovation is becoming a distinct management function in the lines of marketing, HR, etc. Businesses need to be ambidextrous in their thinking taking into account capabilities of both right (creative) and left (analytical) side of the brain as challenges faced today requires integral solutions. The need is to work in cross functional teams, develop deep understanding of customer role, collaborate and more importantly address customer needs that may even not known to them; rather than just apply branding or fancy design styling. Fundamentals to integral approach are collaboration, embracing multidimensionality, systems thinking and applying cybernetics principles. The integral approach should involve users, designers, customers and suppliers. One need to understand the user based on fieldwork study, reach insights into user role and discover unarticulated needs. We normally measure innovation in terms of its technical strength and its utility value. In many cases this may not be enough. Innovation is a renewal process in that it prepares one for the future. It involves investing in the development of competence of the people, developing capabilities in them, nurturing customer relationships, and organizing knowledge bases. The point where technical innovation gets done is at the core of all these activities. The Balanced Score Card (BSC) has aroused considerable interest in the last two decades in business performance measurement. The reason could be that the managers are finding something more than the short term revenue reports that are prevalent. In the similar way the innovation can be looked not just at the point of idea creation but should be viewed as a staged process in the organization for the innovation to see the light of the market in a concerted way. This paper explains a cybernetics approach of modeling the innovation activities along the lines of Balanced Score Card (BSC).The principles of cybernetics may considered to be useful in `how we design” innovations as much as in “what innovations we design”.","","978-1-4673-0892-2","10.1109/CyberneticsCom.2012.6381625","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6381625","Innovation;key processes;cybernetics;balanced score card (BSC)","Technological innovation;Companies;Cybernetics;Innovation management;Couplings","","","","7","IEEE","14 Feb 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For a multi-agent systems (MAS) modeling of an ITS, the computation burden is large, as it involves the computation of the state changing of all the agents. And, there are many multi-objective optimization problems in the ITS research. In this paper, we solve the traffic light signaling optimization problem and we take the average delay time and the average stop times as two objectives. We use a famous method of Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). As NSGA-II can be viewed as an intelligent way of running a number of micro-simulations, usually the computation burden is huge. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have been a popular tool for parallel computing. The real transportation system runs in parallel and we think that a parallel tool is more suitable for the simulation and optimization of the system. We test GPU based NSGA-II method on a 4 intersection lattice road network, and on the 18 intersection road network of the Zhongguancun area of Beijing.

Saving film costs for each shot is not only of advantage of this transition. The more important advantage by this digitization is that forming optically a completed image on detector is not necessary and acquired data are processable by a computer. We can think that, with optional optical system-lens array-, acquired data can be nuggets of information which contains both image and its depth or bunch of incident rays which are equal value to actual 3-D scene. These data represent 3-D situations and by computing them, various optical effect, e.g. focusing and changing field of depth, can also be realized or simulated virtually. My issue is to clarify how 3-D scene is transformed and expressed on 2-D detector and how this 2-D information is retrieved back again into 3-D scene through lens array and other optical devices. Light-field optics or lens array is one of those exchangeable methods of the transformation between actual 3-D scene and information encoded on 2-D plane. Recently new method for lens array was introduced; a circular zone plate instead of lens array. As for a 3-D Display which consists of flat display and lens array, the encoded data shown on a flat display and they are retrieved into real 3-D image by a lens-array. I will mention not only its advantage but its limitation of ability for 3-D image reconstruction.","","978-1-5386-0905-7","10.1109/WIO.2017.8038113","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8038113","computational imaging;three-dimensional image;displays;image reconstruction-restoration","Lenses;Optical imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Image reconstruction;Holography;Cameras;Holographic optical components","","","","9","IEEE","18 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It displays an often-used method, which is applied in each field of computer science to investigate, describe and plan problems or structures. With the help of models, large and complex structures are divided into smaller parts, which leads to a better understanding of the problem and often provides input for the solution. With the help of different types of models, different perspectives of one problem can be observed and discussed. These processes are not only part of computer science respectively computational thinking. Problem solving skills are needed in any domain and should be trained as well as possible in primary and secondary education. This could be supported by the computer science concept of modeling including processes like reduction, decomposition, abstraction, generalization etc. and appropriate techniques like UML Unified Modeling Language or the Entity-relationship model. We suppose that a consequent use of modeling beginning in different subjects during primary and secondary education can train and improve problem-solving skills. Before being able to verify this hypothesis, it is necessary to find a way to integrate modeling in schools despite of not being part of the curriculum. This is one aim of our project “Informatics - A Child's Play”, which tries to implement different computer science concepts in different subjects of primary and secondary education. To reach this goal we firstly have to convince and train teachers. In this paper some topics of modeling are presented as they were adapted for workshops in primary and early secondary education considering the age and interests of the students as well as topics taken from their surroundings. Furthermore, we present first evaluation results concerning its acceptance and usefulness for teachers and students as well as their performance in understanding and applying modeling in different lessons.","","978-1-4799-8454-1","10.1109/FIE.2015.7344062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7344062","models;diagrams;general education;Entity-Relationship-model","Computational modeling;Education;Mathematical model;Unified modeling language;Informatics;Conferences","","5","","10","IEEE","7 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The designers know that the mobile clients could have a different application flow than desktop clients. However, this is not a rule and designers often times do not think about the user context nor do they consider the application context. This implies that outputs, inputs and interactions do not change automatically during the software life cycle. In this paper we present techniques that are able to determine whether the user, which is in a particular context, should be required to spend his/her time to fill in fields that are not needed for accomplishing a specific business task. Moreover, these techniques are able to determine whether the fields should display or are not necessary, as well as how the system might interact with the user.

This paper is inspired by the embedded, “system of systems (SoS) thinking” in the context of military programming. The purpose of this paper is to draw a conceptual framework for a smart tourism industry information system in responding to competitive challenges. The approach here is to illustrate how this SoS thinking and corresponding SoS engineering (SoSE) may be applied through the top-level design for the smart system. For designing a policy maker-responsive, informative system, an emerging complex spatial information approach, geographical simulation, is introduced. This holistic means includes: 1) simulation of the tourism SoS' architecture and evolution process through cellular automata (CA) and multi-agent systems (MAS) techniques, based on remote sensing data and GIS instrument; 2) illustration of the mechanism of industrial evolution by scale-free network analysis and social influence network with dynamic Bayesian network theory.

To solve a problem, systems thinking requires the building of a model by a diverse group with a varied input. The group modeling process which is an important process of system dynamics intervention in organizations is mainly developed by researchers from similar backgrounds and cultures. A research conducted in Israel, a country with a mixture of cultures and social backgrounds, evokes a different experience and approach to the more known group model building techniques. Since the participants in the group were from diverse backgrounds in terms of their culture, economic situation and their work position, they could easily be led by their social condition in their thinking and opinions. Therefore, knowledge elicitation through the group model building process during the group sessions and on the other hand, knowledge elicitation through personal conversation brought up contradictory information and called for constantly improving the elicitation process.","2159-5100","978-1-890843-29-8","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921307","","Feedback loop;Buildings;Organizations;Computational modeling;Mathematical model;Production;Maintenance engineering","","","","14","","13 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many universities in the process base the selection on the academic skills and consequently problems will appear when an individual should evaluate all the job criteria as he or she enters employment. Through this paper the researchers would like to propose a model, AHP-TOPSIS, for the process of selecting new university students and for predicting their future employment. With the sample of 30 students from Diploma 3 Aeronautics STTA Yogyakarta, an evaluation model was designed using the indicators of academic skills, English proficiency skills, psycho test, soft skills (communication, problem solving and critical thinking, time management, cooperation, and adaptation skills), and attitudes. The load for these indicators were attained using the AHP and then these indicators would be calculated using the TOPSIS in order to find the alternative rank of the students' selection. The rank was determined by gathering the interest score from the calculation using the AHP so that the integrated evaluation results could be provided. The main objective of this paper was assisting the decision-makers in the process of selecting new university students who have both academic and personality skills that would be necessary to support their performance in the future employment.","","978-1-5386-0903-3","10.1109/ICICOS.2017.8276349","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8276349","criteria;university student selection;AHP;TOPSIS","Employment;Analytic hierarchy process;Load modeling;Teamwork;Informatics;Predictive models","","7","","22","IEEE","1 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Also, most of transport in India is being carried out by railway network. Still accidents are the major concern in terms of railway track crossing and unidentified crack in rail tracks in Indian railway. About 60% accidents are occurring at railway track crossing and due to crack in railway tracks resulting in loss of precious life and loss of economy. Therefore there is need to think about new technology which is robust, efficient and stable for both automatic gate closure system and crack detection in railway track. This paper proposes an unmanned gate crossing and faulty rail track detection. Unmanned level crossing is a IR sensors base system and crack detection is an dynamic approach which combines the use of GPS (global positioning system) tracking system and GSM (global system for mobile communication) modem to send geographical coordinate of location. Unmanned gate crossing controller system prevents accident which are caused due to railway track crossing and railway crack detection system prevents train derailment by detecting crack in railway track using internet of things technology.","","978-1-5090-5297-4","10.1109/ICICCT.2017.7975189","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7975189","unmanned gate crossingGSM modemGPS moduleIR transmitter and ReceiverInternet of Things technology","Rail transportation;Logic gates;Global Positioning System;Sensor systems;Rails;GSM","","6","","14","IEEE","17 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Kalman in the early sixties of the past century. This system description is in close relationship with linear or at least partly linear system in which the linear part can be used in forming a quadratic Lyapunov function in the stability proof. In the standard model of such systems it is assumed that the state of the system is not directly observable, only certain linear functions of the state variable are directly measurable. Since such approaches introduce certain feedback gains for the state variable, observers are needed that calculate the estimation of the state variable on the basis of directly measurable quantities. The Luenberger observers solve this task via introducing a differential equation for the estimated state. In order to avoid the mathematical difficulties of Lyapunov's “direct method” the “Robust Fixed Point Transformations (RFPT)” were introduced in a novel adaptive technique that instead of the state space representation directly utilized the available approximate model of the system to estimate its “response function”. In this approach it was assumed that the system's response is directly observable and an iterative sequence was generated by the use of “Banach's Fixed Point Theorem” that converged to an appropriate deformation of the rough initial model to obtain precise trajectory tracking. In the present paper it is shown that the Luenberger observers and the RFPT-based mathod can be combined in a more conventional approach of the adaptive controllers that are designed on the basis of finding appropriate feedback gains. Illustrative simulation examples are presented to substantiate this statement.","","978-1-4799-0197-5","10.1109/CINTI.2013.6705223","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6705223","","Observers;Mathematical model;Adaptation models;Equations;Adaptive control;Trajectory","","4","","13","IEEE","9 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This gap is possible since it is assumed that the signal of interest admits a linear decomposition of few vectors in a given sparsifying Basis (Fourier, Wavelet, ...). Unfortunately in realistic operating systems, uncertain knowledge of the CS model is inevitable and must be evaluated. Typically, this uncertainty drastically degrades the estimation performance of sparse-based estimators in the low noise variance regime. In this work, the Off-Grid (OG) and Basis Mismatch (BM) problems are compared in a Bayesian estimation perspective. At first glance, we are tempted to think that these two acronyms stand for the same problem. However, by comparing their Bayesian Cramèr-Rao Bounds (BCRB) for the estimation of a L-sparse amplitude vector based on N measurements, it is shown that the BM problem has a lower BCRB than the OG one in a general context. To go further into the analysis we provide for i.i.d. Gaussian amplitudes and in the low noise variance regime an interesting closed-form expression of a normalized 2-norm criterion of the difference of the two BCRB matrices. Based on the analysis of this closed-form expression, we obtain two conclusions. Firstly, the two uncertainty problems cannot be confused for a non-zero mismatch error variance and with finite N and L. Secondly, the two problems turn to be similar for any mismatch error variance in the large system regime, i.e., for N, L → ∞ with constant aspect ratio N/L → ρ.","","978-1-4799-1963-5","10.1109/CAMSAP.2015.7383826","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7383826","Compressed Sensing with Uncertainty;Off-Grid effect and Basis Mismatch;Bayesian estimation","Dictionaries;Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Estimation;Context;Compressed sensing;Reactive power","","1","","17","IEEE","21 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We take Sina Weibo, the largest micro-blogging platform in China, and Douban Movie, the most popular movie community in China, two platforms as background data. We form a graph with their information to combine social and professional influence together, which is the fundamental of SPIA influence model. We try to check the efficiency of SPIA influence model by using of Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient with Forbes celebrity list. After a series of experiments, we think SPIA influence can merge actors' social influence and professional influence well, and help to choose the most influential actors.","","978-1-4673-8660-9","10.1109/CIS.2015.62","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396292","actor influence;SPIA influence model;data fusion;h-index","Motion pictures;Silicon;Nickel;Correlation;Internet;Indexes;Social network services","","","","13","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Especially in birds there is something that can reproduce human's pronunciation. For monkeys as well, it is possible to perform human pronunciation functionally in terms of airway configuration. However, these animals do not have language features. In recent years, research and development of AI which gained a deep impression on deep learning and big data is prevalent. After learning sound, AI can recognize and utter a conversation. Monkeys can see things by eye, recognize them, and eat for food if it is food. AI can cause the robot to take similar actions. Given the mechanism of speech recognition, it is identified as a word unit, a phrase or a sentence by identification of sound, coding of maximum likelihood, and probabilistic syllable estimation using existing databases such as triphones. It can be thought that birds or monkeys can do this sound again through the articulation mechanism. However, it is impossible to freely extract words and phrases from learned sentences, create sentences with new meanings, and pronounce them. Here, I think that the boundary of presence or absence of language is the presence or absence of this function. I'm studying to predict the factors that language has in human beings from the dental field. In the dental field, various information such as the shape of teeth and jaws are accumulated historically and over time. Recent studies have shown that vowels can be pronounced like humans, not humans. However, it is my expectation that consonants, especially fricatives, that adjust the advanced sound with the tongue will probably be difficult. Even children, it is difficult to pronounce fricatives until about 6 years old. I have been conducting research using aerodynamic acoustic techniques to understand why it is difficult to acquire fricative sounds, so I will tell you about things that have been understood so far.","","978-1-5386-1023-7","10.1109/ICIEV.2017.8338531","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338531","","Dentistry;Artificial intelligence;Informatics;Birds;Hospitals;Research and development","","","","","IEEE","19 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Anti-counterfeit to prevent fake drugs requires rapid-authenticating, costless, and more than anythings, high-security technology. Recent advances in nanotechnology accelerate developments of nanotag identifiers. Thinking of rapidness and high security in authentication, surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) produced from well-designed noble metal nanostructure is promised to apply new authentication method. We have developed SERS active nanostructures by self-assembling of gold nanoparticles (AuNP) with Raman active reporting molecules. A few nanogram amounts of the AuNP assembles were directly deposited onto commercial tablet Mucodyne. For on-dose authentication outside of a laboratory, 80 g weight and smart-phone driven palm-top Raman detector was used. Shelf-life in SERS activity of the AuNP self-assemble liquid stocked at room temperature was over six months. The nanotag labeled Mucodyne tablet showed special SERS signal derived from the reporting molecule, and 0.2 s irradiation of 785 nm (5 mW) laser was enough to produce distinguishable SERS spectra from intact tablet. Excellent longevity of SERS signal over three years on the labeled tablets was confirmed. By just 0.2 second laser irradiation with a palmtop Raman spectrometer, rapid on-dose authentication was successfully achieved.","","978-1-5386-1023-7","10.1109/ICIEV.2017.8338533","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338533","","Authentication;Drugs;Self-assembly;Radiation effects;Lasers;Informatics;Hyperspectral sensors","","","","","IEEE","19 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contact point between the glenoid and the humeral head, tension of soft tissue, and alignment of muscles connecting the bones drastically change in its range of motion. Mechanism stabilizing shoulder joint is influenced by arm positioning. Assessment of joint stability should always take arm positioning into consideration. In fact, there is a subtle instability which can only be detected when the arm is elevated. The glenoid dysplasia might be a cause for its instability. These findings can be detected only by 3D computer generated images except in some typical cases. Generally, joint stability is judged by location of the humeral head center in the glenoid. More intricate approach is necessary for some disorders. Analysis of contact area and other glenohumeral relation can clarify instability which cannot be detected through investigating location of joint center. The studies using those parameters showed that the joint is inherently unstable with the arm externally rotated at 90 degrees of elevation, and that joint positioning would be more apt to be affected from the cocking to the acceleration phase during throwing activity. We think such instability might lead to throwing disorders.","","978-1-5386-1023-7","10.1109/ICIEV.2017.8338541","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8338541","","Joints;Shoulder;Biomechanics;Head;Stability analysis;Informatics;Biomedical imaging","","","","","IEEE","19 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Quaiyum Ansari","JamiaMilliaIslamia (A Central University), New-Delhi, India",2017 International Conference on Intelligent Communication and Computational Techniques (ICCT),"26 Mar 2018","2017","","","11","15","Prof. LotfiAskarZadeh had revolutionized the field of logics by proposing a novel logic, Fuzzy Logic, in 1965 where there is smooth transition between different classes due to overlapping of membership functions, and each element in fuzzy set has a degree of membership. Fuzzy Logic was considered appropriate to represent any vague or ambiguous situation of the real life problems. It also has the provision of allowing linguistic variables whose truth values may vary between 0 and 1; in contrast to two values of classical logic. Quite recently, Neutrosophic Logic was proposed by Florentine Smarandache, which is based on non-standard analysis that was given by Abraham Robinson in 1960s. Neutrosophic Logic was developed to represent mathematical model of uncertainty, vagueness, ambiguity, imprecision, undefined, unknown, incompleteness, inconsistency, redundancy, and contradiction that encompasses the shortcomings of every other logic studied in the past. All the factors stated are very integral to human thinking, as it is very rare that we tend to conclude/judge in definite environments, imprecision of human systems could be due to the imperfection of knowledge that human receives (observation) from the external world. Imperfection leads to a doubt about the value of a variable, a decision to be taken or a conclusion to be drawn for the actual system. Multiple factors could lead to uncertainty like incomplete knowledge (ignorance of the totality, limited view on a system because of its complexity), stochasticity (the case of intrinsic imperfection where a typical and single value does not exist), or the acquisition errors (intrinsically imperfect observations, the quantitative errors in measures). This talk would focus on the overlapping regions of the fuzzy systems in which a method has been proposed for using neutrosophic logic and assign a triplet of the form (t, i, f) for the points that are spanned by overlapping ranges, in such a way that every such output is assigned a true, indeterminate and false value.","","978-1-5386-3030-3","10.1109/INTELCCT.2017.8324067","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8324067","","Medical services;Conferences;Automotive engineering;Computer security;Fuzzy logic;Internet","","","","","IEEE","26 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Very often, the users look at the web as a place where they can find an individual or group of people with the same or similar interests, or even find new friends. Such situation is reflected in one of the aspects of the web 2.0 called tagging. Tagging is a process of labeling (annotating) digital items-resources-by users. The labels-tags-assigned to those resources reflect users' ways of seeing, categorizing, and perceiving particular items. In general, a single user can label a number of items with a number of different tags. The results of this activity-labeled items and used tags-can be perceived as information characterizing the user. This paper describes an approach for constructing a user signature representing her interests and opinions based on used items and tags. The signature is determined as a fuzzy relation built on two fuzzy sets proposed here: a fuzzy set representing resource attractiveness, and a fuzzy set representing tag popularity. Furthermore, users' signatures are used to determine similarity between users, and potentially give users a method to find new web friends with similar interests and opinions. The paper also describes a process of building different signatures representing a group of users. Signatures of users that are members of the group are aggregated using OWA operator and different linguistic quantifiers to describe the group in a number of ways. A real-world case study illustrating the process of finding similar users and/or groups of users is included.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2227263","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6353201","Cardinality of fuzzy sets;fuzzy sets;similarity of signatures;social networks;tagging;user and group signature","Tagging;Social network services;Fuzzy sets;Labeling;Buildings;Measurement","","20","","34","IEEE","15 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

And then, some new operations and related properties about the new defined order relation are presented. Third, by combining bipolar-valued fuzzy set with the rough set theory, the concept of the bipolar-valued rough fuzzy set is developed, which is the first attempt to consider inconsistent bipolarity into rough set theory. Particularly, by introducing two new operations to the rough set theory, the widely existing information losing problem in the computation process is solved. Furthermore, parameter-related and parameter-free rough degrees about the bipolar-valued fuzzy sets in a crisp approximation space are introduced. Finally, the bipolar-valued fuzzy decision information system is given; then, both the attribute reduction method and the knowledge discovery method based on the proposed roughness degree are presented.

This would be much more powerful and general purpose when combined with other existing well-known algorithmic solutions that exist for conventional computing architectures using a suitable ALU. Thus, a specifically designed DNA Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU) that can address operations suitable for both domains can mitigate the gap between these two. An ALU must be able to perform all possible logic operations, including NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, and XNOR; compare, shift etc., integer and floating point arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). In this paper, design of an ALU has been proposed using sticker-based DNA model with experimental feasibility analysis. Novelties of this paper may be in manifold. First, the integer arithmetic operations performed here are 2s complement arithmetic, and the floating point operations follow the IEEE 754 floating point format, resembling closely to a conventional ALU. Also, the output of each operation can be reused for any next operation. So any algorithm or program logic that users can think of can be implemented directly on the DNA computer without any modification. Second, once the basic operations of sticker model can be automated, the implementations proposed in this paper become highly suitable to design a fully automated ALU. Third, proposed approaches are easy to implement. Finally, these approaches can work on sufficiently large binary numbers.","1558-2639","","10.1109/TNB.2017.2726682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7979622","DNA computing;DNA ALU;sticker model","DNA;DNA computing;Computational modeling;Search problems;Parallel processing;Electron tubes;Algorithm design and analysis","Computer Simulation;Computer-Aided Design;Computers, Molecular;DNA;Equipment Design;Equipment Failure Analysis;Feasibility Studies;Models, Chemical;Models, Genetic;Models, Molecular;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted","8","","26","IEEE","13 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We propose that `truth' or `real' has very little to do with how we feel about our avatar creations which are in effect self-portraits. Their existence reveals our desires, yearnings, fears and insecurities. The avatar is an animated, performed image which mirrors our desire to inject it with subjectivity, while at the same time thinking of it as an object. Avatar embodiment also points us to the technological sublime.

The total brain atrophy and specifically the hippocampal atrophy are considered strong diagnostic tests for AD. T1 weighted MRIs have been used for the purpose of image processing to evaluate atrophy. The paper demonstrates the applications of several image processing techniques such as K-means clustering, wavelet transform, watershed algorithm and also a customized algorithm tailored for the specific case. It has been implemented on the open source platforms, OpenCV and Qt, which facilitates the implementation and utility of the developed product in the hospitals without requiring any proprietary software. The results obtained from the project could aid the analysis to detect AD along with correlation with the psychiatric results and could thus assist the doctors in detecting AD at an early stage.

The group authentication is designed for group-oriented applications. A lot of user authentication schemes only support one-to-one principle of authentication. However, network applications are no longer one-to-one communication, multiple users may be involved. So the scheme proposed a many-to-many communication. The scheme is based on Shamir's (t, n) threshold secret sharing scheme. The threshold scheme can protect a secret with high security and reliability when all the participants are honest. If some dishonest participants exist, the other honest participants may obtain a false secret which will lead to a false authentication, making them think all the participants are in the same group. It can reveal the content of the communication between them. We improve the t-secure m-user n-group authentication scheme, where t is the threshold of the scheme, m is the number of participants in the group authentication, and n is the number of members of the group.

In order to accommodate as many requests as possible, Data Centers typically deploy oversubscription, which requires a thoughtfully calibrated usage of the computing and network resources of the system. We especially need to re-think the usage of network resources, as the kinds of demands from applications we see today have more stringent network requirements than in the past. The Software-Defined Network paradigm offers new tools to manage the network in agile, flexible ways, according to specific needs. It enables to build new customized functions in order, for example, to monitor the instantaneous load of traffic, slice the network, route each flow according to specific policies that can be modified accordingly with the needs of the system.

Providing timely, personalized feedback that makes students reflect about what and why they did correctly or incorrectly is critical in such courses. However, the limited number of instructors and the great volume of submissions instructors need to assess, especially in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), prove this task a challenge. One solution is to hire graders or create peer discussions among students, however, feedback may be too general, incomplete or even incorrect. Automatic techniques focus on: a) Functional testing, in which feedback usually does not sufficiently guide novices, b) Software verification to find code bugs, which may confuse novices since these tools usually skip true errors or produce false errors, and c) Comparing using reference solutions, in which a large amount of reference solutions or pre-existing correct submissions are usually required. This paper presents a semantic-aware technique to provide personalized feedback that aims to mimic an instructor looking for code snippets in student submissions. These snippets are modeled as subgraph patterns with natural language feedback attached to them. Submissions are transformed into extended program dependence graphs combining control and data flows. We leverage subgraph matching techniques to compute the adequate personalized feedback. Also, constraints correlating patterns allow performing fine-grained assessments. We have evaluated our method on several introductory programming assignments and a large number of submissions. Our technique delivered personalized feedback in milliseconds using a small set of patterns, which makes it appealing in real-world settings.","2375-026X","978-1-5090-6543-1","10.1109/ICDE.2017.169","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7930065","","Tools;Programming;Software;Testing;Computer bugs;Knowledge based systems;Pattern matching","","29","","41","IEEE","18 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research questions focus on understanding which is the best medium to design algorithms by comparing flow chart and the Scratch programming language and by evaluating whether using textual language is worth the effort of the syntactic burden imposed by these languages. An analysis of quantitative and qualitative data revealed that both a visual programming and a flow-chart approach are suitable for algorithm design with no statistical difference in terms of number of errors and time taken to write the corresponding code in a textual language.

The findings provide insights on how the examined factors may have a different influence for boys and girls, an outcome that can be used to re-design educational programs targeting maximizing engagement regardless gender.","2161-377X","978-1-5386-3870-5","10.1109/ICALT.2017.78","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8001845","programming;making;young students;computer science education;fsQCA","Programming profession;Conferences;Calibration;Correlation;Education;Complexity theory","","3","","32","IEEE","7 Aug 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computerization of Bangla language processing has been started a long ago, but still it is in neophyte stage and suffers from resource scarcity. We propose anunsupervised machine learning technique to develop Bangla word clusters based on their semantic and contextual similarity using N-gram language model. According to N-gram model, a word can be predictedbased on its previous and next words sequence. N-gram model is applied successfully for word clustering in English and some other languages. As word clustering in Bangla is a new dimension in Bangla language processing research, so we think this process is good way to start and our assumption is true as our result is quite decent. We produced 456 clusters using a locally available large Bangla corpus.

More specifically, they give an equal weight to each of the items which are rated by both users. However, we think that the similarity between the target item and each of the co-rated items is a very important factor when we calculate the similarity between two users. Therefore, in this paper we propose a new similarity function that takes similarities between a target item and each of the co-rated items and the proportion of common ratings into account.

Due to its high economic interest, at high speeds it will replace conventional fieldbus systems. Indeed, Industrial automation, Aircraft, Railway, Automotive and others domains, are increasingly being controlled via the Ethernet network. Its interest to be used in automotive field, in the powertrain and chassis domains, is growing day by day. Next-generation vehicles will be also controlled based on their interactions with the infrastructure as well as the environment. The cloud computing will be used to exchange real-time sensing and control information through vehicular wireless networks based on WiFi, WiGig and 5G networks. However, these networks are not developed for real-time vehicular control compliance. The use of Ethernet and wireless networks as a real-time control network for critical systems like powertrain and chassis vehicle domains is frequently questioned. Different solutions to modify them to meet real-time requirements have been proposed. This paper is interested to give more details concerning exactly this point. We will demonstrate that Ethernet and WiGig, when adducting the QoS priority policy and the duplication of the controllers in the end-points, can satisfy the real-time requirements when the throughput exceeds one Gbits/s that is, the modifications in each endpoint is quite simple to do. As many may think, the FlexRay network is mandatory for the powertrain and chassis modules and the Ethernet, the Wi-Fi, or its next generation, the WiGiG, can only support the body and multimedia domains. Its comparison with the Ethernet or the WiGiG proves that these latter networks are better when exceeding few gigabits per second for the four domains, with a minimum latency budget. We used the Network queuing theory to do these evaluations. We completed the classical four domains by two new domains, which are the advance driver assistance system and the V2X communications. These new domains are also connected via the full duplex Ethernet backbone, known as AFDX and μAFDX switching elements.","","978-1-5386-2113-4","10.1109/IINTEC.2017.8325938","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8325938","Ethernet;GBE;WiGig;FlexRay;QoS;RealTime;Priority Policy;Latency;SAE Benchmark;Vehicle Blockset","Switches;Delays;Task analysis;Automotive engineering;Queueing analysis;Computational modeling;Throughput","","3","","12","IEEE","29 Mar 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the proposed scheme, a chain in each region works as PEGASIS. We also study how considering heterogeneity in the network can improve the lifetime of a network by a significant period. We assume that a fraction of the nodes in the network possess additional energy.

Roughly speaking, network models aim at gaining a better understanding of how actors influence the overall network behaviour through their individual actions. However, considering the extended literature surrounding the subject, one is entitled to think that moving beyond the state-of-the-art in network modeling requires the ability to compare models, or consider slight variations of a model. This requires having a common language describing all considered models, allowing to objectively compare them and unfold their inherent properties and complexity. This also assumes users can easily run models, steer them and interactively evaluate their performance and behaviour. The approach we describe aims at providing a framework turning network propagation modeling into rule-based modeling (aka graph rewriting). That is, models are described as a set of algorithmic transformation rules acting locally. Our approach has partially been validated by providing such a description of a well-known model relying on probabilistic rules, where nodes trigger actions depending on their neighbor's influences. The results so obtained confirm rule-based modeling as a promising avenue. The use of a visual analytics framework to conduct such tasks is vital and motivated us to further develop and adapt a general purpose visual analytics system for graph rewriting to the particular case of network propagation.","","978-1-4799-6227-3","10.1109/VAST.2014.7042530","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7042530","I.2.4 [Artificial Intelligence]: Knowledge Representation — Formalisms and Methods;F.1.2 [Computation by Abstract Devices]: Modes of Computation","Mathematical model;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Visual analytics;Data mining;Adaptation models","","2","","10","IEEE","16 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this talk, I will describe the TIOA framework in some detail, and summarize many of the examples to which it has been applied.

In their place, I will propose a novel data-centric foundation for parallel programming called the operator formulation in which algorithms are described in terms of unitary actions on data structures. This data-centric view of parallel algorithms shows that a generalized form of data-parallelism called amorphous data-parallelism is ubiquitous even in complex, irregular graph applications such as mesh generation and partitioning algorithms, graph analytics, and machine learning applications. Binding time considerations provide a unification of parallelization techniques ranging from static parallelization to speculative parallelization. We have built a system called Galois, based on these ideas, for exploiting amorphous data-parallelism on multicores and GPUs.

Business process models have gained significant importance due to their critical role for managing business processes.Still, process models display a wide range of quality problems. For example, literature reports on error rates between 10% and20% in industrial process model collections. Most research in the context of quality issues in process models puts a strongemphasis on the product or outcome of the process modeling act (i.e., the resulting process models), while the process followed for creating process models is only considered to a limited extent. The creation of process models involves the elicitation of requirements from the domain as well as the formalization of these requirements as process models. In this presentation the focus will be on the formalization of process models, which can be considered a process by itself-the process of processmodeling (PPM).In particular, this keynote will discuss how the PPM can be captured and analyzed. For this, it will present a specialized modeling environment, which logs all interactions of the process modeler with the modeling environment, thus, providing the infrastructure to investigate the PPM. The keynote will also shed light on the way how process models are created, present different behavioral patterns that can be observed, and discuss factors that influence the PPM, e.g., modeler-specific factors like domain knowledge or process modeling competence and task-specific factors. In addition, the keynote will provide an outline on how methods like eye movement analysis, think aloud, or the analysis of bio-feedback (e.g., heart rate variability)might enable even deeper insights into the PPM.","1541-7719","978-1-4799-5470-4","10.1109/EDOC.2014.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6972065","","Computational modeling;Context modeling;Business;Conferences;Computer science;Educational institutions;Abstracts","","","","","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Empirical Modelling (EM) is an approach to computing which includes, but is much broader than, traditional computer science. It occupies a territory where experience is more prominent than abstractions, where state has priority over pre-conceived behaviours and where the agencies behind state change (human or otherwise) are first identified. Extensive research, and teaching of this approach to final year computer science students, over many years under the leadership of Meurig Beynon at the University of Warwick has resulted in a large body of artefacts, environments and publications. They can be found at http://go.warwick.ac.uk/em At the core of EM is an activity we call `making construals'. By a `construal of X' we mean `what we think of X' or `how we make sense of X'. As well as being a personal product of the maker it is at the same time an interactive computer artefact. The development method we adopt allows passage from the mere contemplation of a phenomenon or problem to the crafting of a program-like behaviour that is useful. We shall demonstrate this and explain the advantages of the approach, in at least some domains such as learning, when compared with existing programming paradigms. We have called the approach `human computing' in recognition that its `programs' - in both development and ways of use - have much more of the human qualities of flexibility, and multiple viewpoints, than is usual in a computing environment. It promotes closer collaboration between the human and computer. We shall report on the progress and challenges of the EU Project CONSTRUIT! which is half-way through its three-year duration. With its six European partners CONSTRUIT! seeks to promote the making of construals among teachers and students (at all levels) and to evaluate the effectiveness of this activity for learning across many subjects.

In this study the fundamentals of his concepts are identified and re-elaborated in a more formal way, with the aim of developing an operational and dynamic functional structure that evolves over time and that includes the affective value of objects. On this basis a computational implementation of the conscious-unconscious interaction that employs Learning Classifier Systems (LCS) is put forward. The reason for this choice is that LCS have a structural affinity with the proposed ideas, and in particular they allow to model directly the psychodynamic concept of “internal reality”.","","978-1-4799-6081-1","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2014.6921458","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6921458","Psychodynamic unconscious;Internal reality;Meaning-making;Affect;Salience;Learning Classifier Systems","Object recognition;Transforms;Shape;Semantics;History;Educational institutions;Computational modeling","","","","9","IEEE","16 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Polar coding gives the first known explicit construction with rigorous proofs of all these properties; previous constructions were not known to achieve capacity with less than  $\exp (1/ \varepsilon )$  decoding complexity except for erasure channels. We establish the capacity-achieving property of polar codes via a direct analysis of the underlying martingale of conditional entropies, without relying on the martingale convergence theorem. This step gives rough polarization (noise levels  $\approx \varepsilon $  for the good channels), which can then be adequately amplified by tracking the decay of the channel Bhattacharyya parameters. Our effective bounds imply that polar codes can have block length (and encoding/decoding complexity) bounded by a polynomial in  $1/ \varepsilon $ . The generator matrix of such polar codes can be constructed in polynomial time by algorithmically computing an adequate approximation of the polarization process.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2014.2371819","Packard Fellowship; MSR-CMU Center for Computational Thinking; NSF(grant numbers:CCF-0963975,CCF-1422045); NSF Graduate Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6960872","Information theory;error-correction codes;linear codes;Channel polarization;entropy;maximum likelihood decoding;symmetric capacity","Decoding;Error probability;Polynomials;Entropy;Convergence;Complexity theory;Capacity planning","","53","","32","IEEE","20 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While this is an impossible goal to achieve against unrestricted tampering functions, rather surprisingly non-malleable coding becomes possible against every fixed family P of tampering functions that is not too large (for instance, when I≤I 22αn for some α <; 1, where n is the number of bits in a codeword). In this paper, we study the capacity of non-malleable codes, and establish optimal bounds on the achievable rate as a function of the family size, answering an open problem from Dziembowski et al. Specifically, We prove that for every family P with IFI I≤I 22αn, there exist non-malleable codes against P with rate arbitrarily close to 1-α [this is achieved with high probability (w.h.p.) by a randomized construction]. We show the existence of families of size exp(nO(1)2αn) against which there is no non-malleable code of rate 1 - α (in fact this is the case w.h.p for a random family of this size). We also show that 1 - α is the best achievable rate for the family of functions, which are only allowed to tamper the first αn bits of the codeword, which is of special interest. As a corollary, this implies that the capacity of non-malleable coding in the split-state model (where the tampering function acts independently but arbitrarily on the two halves of the codeword, a model which has received some attention recently) equals 1/2. We also give an efficient Monte Carlo construction of codes of rate close to 1 with polynomial time encoding and decoding that is non-malleable against any fixed c > 0 and family P of size 2nc, in particular tampering functions with, say, cubic size circuits.","1557-9654","","10.1109/TIT.2015.2511784","Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung(grant numbers:PA00P2-141980); MSR-CMU Center for Computational Thinking; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:CCF-0963975); Packard Fellowship; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7365445","Cryptography;cryptographic protocols;codes;privacy;data security;Cryptography;cryptographic protocols;codes;privacy;data security","Encoding;Decoding;Monte Carlo methods;Computer science;Cryptography;Electronic mail;Probabilistic logic","","14","","19","IEEE","24 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the number of attacks launched on computer networks and software, businesses and IT professionals are taking steps to ensure that their information systems are as secure as possible. However, many programmers do not think about adding security to their programs until their projects are near completion. This is a major mistake because a system is as secure as its weakest link. If security is viewed as an afterthought, it is highly likely that the resulting system will have a large number of vulnerabilities, which could be exploited by attackers. One of the reasons programmers overlook adding security to their code is because it is viewed as a complicated or time-consuming process. This paper presents a tool that will help programmers think more about security and add security tactics to their code with ease. We created a model that learns from existing open source projects and documentation using machine learning and text mining techniques. Our tool contains a module that runs in the background to analyze code as the programmer types and offers suggestions of where security could be included. In addition, our tool fetches existing open source implementations of cryptographic algorithms and sample code from repositories to aid programmers in adding security easily to their projects.","","978-1-5386-2726-6","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285247","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285247","Cybersecurity;hybrid;machine learning;text mining;code analysis","Tools;Static analysis;Testing;Frequency measurement;Application security;Data models","","3","","43","IEEE","8 Feb 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our study uses simple acoustic and visual nonverbal features extracted from multimodal data, which have been recorded in previously uninvestigated scenarios, and consider all five personality traits and not just a subset. First, we look at the human-machine interaction scenario, where we introduce the display of different “collaboration levels.” Second, we look at the contribution of the human-human interaction (HHI) scenario on the emergence of personality traits. Investigating the HHI scenario creates a stronger basis for future human-agents interactions. Our goal is to study, from a computational approach, the emergence degree of the five personality traits in these two scenarios.

Thus, the pattern of associations in the mind is thought to be a critical factor in determining the ideas - both familiar and unfamiliar - that thought can generate. The Itinerant Dynamics with Emergent Attractors (IDEA) model has been proposed as a computational representation of the process by which ideas might emerge in an associative memory system. However, the effect of how “association” is defined in this context remains an important unexplored issue. In this paper, we consider three different ways of defining associations between concepts based on their joint usage in texts, and show that these lead to very different dynamics in the process of emergent conceptual combinations. We use data from two real-world text corpora to instantiate the model: The collected poems of Dylan Thomas, and the Memoirs of the economist Ludwig von Mises. The two sources differ greatly in the nature of their content as well as the statistics of their word usage, which makes them interesting subjects for comparison.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1960-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280854","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280854","","Mixers","","8","","47","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Metatuning: A pedagogical framework for a generative STEM education in game design-based learning","L.

There are numerous factors that contribute to these disparities, such as poverty, low status and other sociocultural factors in classrooms that impede learning. Difficulties in STEM Education engagement and encumbered participation are often due to decontextualized learning - incongruence between meaningful contexts and learning processes. Game based learning methods are common STEM Ed models that provide youth with extrinsically motivating knowledge frameworks for learning, however, research has proven that even these procedural spaces often are disconnected from students' social and cultural realities. Amidst the STEM Ed achievement gaps problematic are similar disparities found in popular video game spaces, where there is a less than 20% chance that these same disparity groups will navigate computational worlds with protagonists that look like them. These gamers/students are lacking the “under-the-hood” (STEM) knowledge of the very games they engage with on a daily basis.

Historically the emphasis has been to educate and support individual “Renaissance scholars”. In today's world, most of the significant problems are systemic problems that transcend not only the individual human mind but cannot be addressed by any one specialty discipline. To cope with these problems requires not only “Renaissance Scholars” but “Renaissance Communities” in which stakeholders coming from different disciplines can collaborate. Our research at the Center for Lifelong Learning & Design (L3D) over the past two decades has been focused on creating a new understanding of learning, new media, and new learning organizations. Our co-evolutionary perspective explores the dialectical relationship between: (1) how a deep understanding of learning creates innovative demands and design criteria for future generations of social-technical environments; (2) how the unique potential of computational media impacts and transforms learning by transcending ""giftwrapping"" and “technology-centered” approaches; and (3) how new learning organizations contribute to reconceptualizing and reinventing learning and education in the 21st century. The conceptual framework is illustrated by specific developments of social-technical environments that we have designed and evaluated including: collaborative, domain-oriented design environments, environments created by mass collaboration, and courses-as-seeds.","","978-1-4673-6404-1","10.1109/CTS.2013.6567198","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6567198","Renaissance Communities;meta-design;cultures of participation;social creativity;communities of interest","Communities;Collaboration;Organizations;Educational institutions;Media;Context","","3","","40","IEEE","25 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we propose a satellite scheduling problem in a vulnerable space environment. A set of complex operational constraints is imposed to make the best defending strategy between task requests and satellites under protection. To reduce the complexity, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems of satellite scheduling and satellite protection. A joint optimization algorithm is adopted to find near optimal solution.

The word ""architecture"" is here defined in the broadest of linguistic manners. This paper outlines the long-term goals for the facilitation of the functional components of this 'system of systems', although the system will be designed to be extensible as a large-scale open source project. Three major components make up the system: 1) one or more databases, 2) a means to generate intelligent queries, and 3) a virtual media space to display media elements and processes as derived from the queries/interaction. I will begin by discussing precursors and historical problems related to computational creativity and symbiotic creative systems. Given the non-linear nature of the subject matter, the following text will progress in a modular manner, where much of the paper could we read in differing orders. Thus, it will not unfold in the linear manner of other more traditional IEEE papers, and should be explored with this intentionality by the reader. The project takes a multi-perspective approach to the subject matter in which no overarching hierarchy can be given, suggesting the need for such a form. Thus I will draw on the IEEE formatting related to ""Component Heads"" -- ""components of your paper and are not topically subordinate to each other."" This structure also mirrors the functionality of the system itself which seeks to explore dynamic heterarchical combinatorics as its overarching methodology as an intelligent system. Thus the reader may need to work harder at making the creative jumps that enable this analogue ""system"" to function by reading each of these different component heads in relation to each other and articulating their own connections between the components. This is a Koestler-like bisociational approach[1]. Thus the paper itself becomes an analogue combinatoric ""architecture"" used to discuss this project.","","978-1-4673-9403-1","10.1109/CW.2015.55","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7398384","Generative Architecture;Generative Art;Recombinant Poetics;Recombinant Informatics;Generative Systems;Cybernetics;Systems Approach","Computer architecture;Media;Artificial intelligence;Architecture;Context;Generators;Sensors","","","","46","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Simultaneous Active Learning of Classifiers & Attributes via Relative Feedback","A. Biswas; D.

However it traditionally views the supervisor simply as a labeling machine. Recently a new interactive learning paradigm was introduced that allows the supervisor to additionally convey useful domain knowledge using attributes. The learner first conveys its belief about an actively chosen image e.g. ""I think this is a forest, what do you think?"". If the learner is wrong, the supervisor provides an explanation e.g. ""No, this is too open to be a forest"". With access to a pre-trained set of relative attribute predictors, the learner fetches all unlabeled images more open than the query image, and uses them as negative examples of forests to update its classifier. This rich human-machine communication leads to better classification performance. In this work, we propose three improvements over this set-up. First, we incorporate a weighting scheme that instead of making a hard decision reasons about the likelihood of an image being a negative example. Second, we do away with pre-trained attributes and instead learn the attribute models on the fly, alleviating overhead and restrictions of a pre-determined attribute vocabulary. Finally, we propose an active learning framework that accounts for not just the label-but also the attributes-based feedback while selecting the next query image. We demonstrate significant improvement in classification accuracy on faces and shoes. We also collect and make available the largest relative attributes dataset containing 29 attributes of faces from 60 categories.","1063-6919","978-1-5386-5672-3","10.1109/CVPR.2013.89","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6618933","Active Learning;Attributes;Relative Feedback;Classification;Large vocabulary;Face images","Entropy;Vocabulary;Footwear;Training data;Training;Computational modeling;Equations","","59","2","25","IEEE","3 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that particular practical adaptations that we have identified serve to ensure that the classroom and educational use cases are appropriately considered. As an example of how those adaptations are realized in actual elementary classrooms, we describe an effort to provide fifth-grade students each with their own Fitbit activity trackers in the context of a multi-week unit exploring core ideas in elementary statistics. Observational descriptions and transcript excerpts of students and teachers discussing their own Fitbit data are presented to illustrate what opportunities exist to leverage youth familiarity with daily activities in a way that targets development of statistical thinking.

In this paper, we describe the process of designing and constructing a system of systems, starting with a provided mapping from the perceived need to a coordinated set of system capabilities that can address that need, some of which are missing capabilities for which new systems are needed. The system engineering aspects of this problem are difficult: the available information about the component system capabilities is always incomplete and often inconsistent, and there can be only approximations of the range of environmental behaviors. For these applications, the design will have to change as the environmental conditions change. These systems are in “continual dynamic development”, which is why we think the systems should manage and perform the integration tasks themselves.

After definitions of discourse marker, turn, floor control types/turn segments, topical units and actions are provided, a list of verbal and nonverbal discourse markers will be given, and they will be grouped into subclasses on the basis of the meaning relations between the linked discourse segments and the type of floor control and thematic control affected. The fundamental question is if discourse markers are key indicators of discourse structure and can be used in the automatic interpretation of utterance meaning and rhetoric relations. The goal of the paper is twofold: firstly, to identify how nonverbal behavior (gestures, posture, gaze) may help disambiguate the actual function(s) of a discourse marker in a given context; secondly, to make explicit how different modalities work together in a synchronized manner in turn regulation and topic control during cooperative interaction. It is examined in twenty spontaneous dialogues of the Hungarian HuComTech multimodal corpus what roles and functions verbal and nonverbal discourse markers play in indicating discourse structure and coherence relations. Concordances and corpus queries presented address both the verbal and nonverbal features of different turn management behavior and topical actions accompanied or supported by discourse markers. Taking a semasiological approach, some of the controversial defining features of discourse markers generally listed in the literature will be tested on a few Hungarian discourse markers: hát (‘well’), tehát (‘so’), mondjuk (‘say’), amúgy (‘otherwise’), egyébként (‘by the way’), szerintem (‘I think’). The features in question regard their position (turn-initiality, topic unit-initiality) as well as the genre-specificity and gender-specificity of their use.","","978-1-4673-5188-1","10.1109/CogInfoCom.2012.6422038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6422038","computational pragmatics;discourse analysis;turn management;topic orientation;discourse structure markers","Floors;Manuals;Pragmatics;Coherence;Human computer interaction;Context;Interviews","","2","","28","IEEE","28 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a cognitive model going beyond rational-actor methods. Having such a model has proven useful when information is uncertain, fragmentary, indirect, soft, conflicting, and even deceptive. Inferences from fusion must then account for uncertainties about the model, the credibility of information, and the fusion methods - i.e. we must consider both structural and parametric uncertainties, including uncertainties about the uncertainties. We use a novel combination of (1) probabilistic and parametric methods, (2) alternative models and model structures, and (3) alternative fusion methods that include nonlinear algebraic combination, variants of Bayesian inference, and a new entropy-maximizing approach. Initial results are encouraging and suggest that such an analytically flexible and model-based approach to fusion can simultaneously enrich thinking, enhance threat detection, and reduce harmful false alarms.","1558-4305","978-1-4673-9743-8","10.1109/WSC.2015.7408367","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7408367","","Uncertainty;Terrorism;Computational modeling;Probabilistic logic;Mathematical model;Bayes methods;Analytical models","","4","","23","IEEE","18 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe a new way of thinking about cognitive control that embodies two basic components: learning and planning, both of which are based on two notions: 1) two-state model of the environment and the perceptor and 2) perception-action cycle, which is a distinctive characteristic of the cognitive dynamic system. Most importantly, it is shown that the cognitive control learning algorithm is a special form of Bellman's dynamic programming. Distinctive properties of the new algorithm include the following: 1) optimality of performance; 2) algorithmic convergence to optimal policy; and 3) linear law of complexity measured in terms of the number of actions taken by the cognitive controller on the environment. To validate these intrinsic properties of the algorithm, a computational experiment is presented, which involves a cognitive tracking radar that is known to closely mimic the visual brain. The experiment illustrates two different scenarios: 1) the impact of planning on learning curves of the new cognitive controller and 2) comparison of the learning curves of three different controllers, based on dynamic optimization, traditional  \(Q\) -learning, and the new algorithm. The latter two algorithms are based on the two-state model, and they both involve the use of planning.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2014.2332333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6843352","Cognitive dyanamic systems;cognitive control;dynamic programming;two-state model;entropic state;Shannon's entropy;explore/exploit tradeoff;learning;planning;Bayesian filtering","Cognition;Heuristic algorithms;Brain modeling;Radar tracking;Dynamic programming;Complexity theory;Perception;Control systems","","52","","26","OAPA","25 Jun 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to encourage developers to take advantage from security solutions proposed by security patterns, we think that it is necessary to provide an appropriate mechanism to implement those patterns using UML profiles. In this paper, we propose structured UML profiles construction process based on security patterns.

This technique gives an advantage to control a micro gripping device from a remote location. End effectors are made of IPMC. IPMC is one of the Electro Active Polymer (EAPs) which holds an excellent bending property at low actuation voltage resulting in high force output, thus it is capable of doing work as good as human finger tip when the same is employed as an actuator for micromanipulation. This device can manipulate micro object less than 1 mm in diameter as well as macro sized object within 10 mm diameter. This finger design is compliant in nature.

We consider mining from a `noisy log' as learning a probability distribution over traces, representing the true process, from a log which is a sample from multiple distributions: the `true' process model and one or more `noise' models. We apply this using a probabilistic analysis of the Heuristics Miner algorithm, and demonstrate on a simple example. We show that for a given model it is possible to predict how much data is needed to mine the underlying model without the noise, and identify differences in the the robustness of Heuristics Miner to different types of noise.","","978-1-4673-5895-8","10.1109/CIDM.2013.6597226","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6597226","","Noise;Data mining;Noise measurement;Probabilistic logic;Business;Algorithm design and analysis;Joints","","4","1","15","IEEE","16 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, although using CA as the base of strong AI is a novel idea, doing so with the current methods available is not possible. Thus, this paper presents a novel CA (RULES-IT) and tests its performance over incomplete data. This algorithm is the first incremental algorithm in its family, and CA as a whole, that transfer rules from different domains and introduce intelligent aspects using simple representation. The performance of RULES-IT will be tested over incomplete and complete data along with other algorithms in the literature.

We first partition the image following SP and extract the mid-level feature for each spatial region. Then our MOS consists of 0th and 1st - order correlation model based on mid-level features. The 0th- order correlation can answer what the mid-level feature represents, and the 1-th order corresponds to spatial contextual information in ambient neighbors. In addition, we apply principal component analysis to reduce the dimension of mid-level features which makes our MOS can be a relatively low dimensionality.

In this paper, we demonstrate that multiple approximation techniques can be applied to applications in these domains and can be further combined together to compound their benefits. In assessing the potential of approximation in these applications, we took the liberty of changing multiple layers of the system stack: architecture, programming model, and algorithms. Across a set of applications spanning the domains of DSP, robotics, and machine learning, we show that hot loops in the applications can be perforated by an average of 50% with proportional reduction in execution time, while still producing acceptable quality of results. In addition, the width of the data used in the computation can be reduced to 10-16 bits from the currently common 32/64 bits with potential for significant performance and energy benefits. For parallel applications we reduced execution time by 50% using relaxed synchronization mechanisms. Finally, our results also demonstrate that benefits compounded when these techniques are applied concurrently. Our results across different applications demonstrate that approximate computing is a widely applicable paradigm with potential for compounded benefits from applying multiple techniques across the system stack. In order to exploit these benefits it is essential to re-think multiple layers of the system stack to embrace approximations ground-up and to design tightly integrated approximate accelerators. Doing so will enable moving the applications into a world in which the architecture, programming model, and even the algorithms used to implement the application are all fundamentally designed for approximate computing.","","978-1-5090-1370-8","10.1109/ICRC.2016.7738674","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7738674","Approximate computing;perforation;reduced precision;relaxed synchronization","Approximate computing;Synchronization;Hardware;Computer architecture;Synthetic aperture radar;Training;Approximation algorithms","","63","","30","IEEE","10 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The sheer number of such connected ubiquitous devices is likely to give rise to a hitherto unforeseen volume of data of different types with a demand for execution of analytical algorithms over the data. On the success of these analytic processes will depend the actual “smartness” of the “Intelligent Infrastructures” which now form the crux of the IoT paradigm. We have seen the advent of cloud-based paradigms to analyse the data in a data-parallel fashion within large data centres which now form the basis of the “big-data” problem. But apart from the servers in the data centres, we potentially have a huge pool of compute resources if we think about the smart devices in and around our homes collectively, which remain relatively idle. In this paper, we present a proposal with some emulated experimental results where we claim that in an IoT framework, the smart devices such as mobile phones, home gateways etc. can be utilised for execution of dataparallel analytic jobs.

We think that automatic construction of a good ontology in a distributed system is an interesting topic for further study. In fact, constructing a good ontology for a mobile communication network, a social network, a traffic control network, and any network related to our daily lives is important to make the network governable, safe, and secure. For large-scale distributed systems (e.g., the Internet), certain self-governability is also indispensable for the network to be more reliable or dependable.

Typically, students are instructed to perform this task through the use of tables or computer software. In this paper, we present and evaluate modules for teaching the foundations of thermodynamics using free open-source software intended to port to students' professional lives. The approach introduces the PYro thermodynamic property calculator. PYro is implemented in Python, which is free and available on most widely used platforms. PYro is clearly documented, and all data are readily traceable to reputable sources. Most of the data describe ideal gases from the NIST JANAF database, but there is also support for mixtures (such as air) and multiphase substances (such as steam). The interface design makes the software appropriate to most tasks in introductory and intermediate thermodynamics courses without requiring proficiency in the Python language. While the idea of using software to teach thermodynamics is far from new, commercial software usually comes at a substantial price and places the implementation burden on the instructor. On the other hand, educational software rarely transitions into students' professional lives. This paper proposes a model for productively separating the development of skills (like table look-ups) from knowledge and concepts. In addition to an introduction of the tool, this paper provides results of preliminary evaluation conducted within a thermodynamics classroom. The authors developed a learning module demonstrating the use of PYro to compute states for an ideal Brayton cycle. Students were tasked with performing parametric analysis on the cycle, by varying various limiting factors (e.g. combustor pressure, turbine inlet temperature). Students were asked to compare power produced and cycle efficiency computed under these conditions. At the end of the module, students were surveyed about the experience of working with the software. Evaluation is provided in the form of instructor and student feedback from a classroom implementation. We propose that this utilization of the tool demonstrates its ability to promote higher-level cognitive thinking in problem solving, removing the time intensive task of performing table look-ups and allowing them to focus on more holistic questions of cycle performance.","","978-1-5090-1790-4","10.1109/FIE.2016.7757589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7757589","","Software;Thermodynamics;Calculators;Education;Temperature;Chemicals;Documentation","","5","","18","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The parallelization of such simulations introduces additional performance penalties in the form of local and global synchronization among cooperating processes. Domain decomposition partitions the largest shareable data structures into sub-domains and attempts to achieve perfect load balance and minimal communication. Up to now research efforts to optimize spatial and temporal cache reuse for stencil-based PDE discretizations (e.g. finite difference and finite element) have considered sub-domain operations after the domain decomposition has been determined. We derive a cache-oblivious heuristic that minimizes cache misses at the sub-domain level through a quasi-cache-directed analysis to predict families of high performance domain decompositions in structured 3-D grids. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work to optimize domain decompositions by analyzing cache misses - thus connecting single core parameters (i.e. cache-misses) to true multicore parameters (i.e. domain decomposition). We analyze the trade-offs in decreasing cache-misses through such decompositions and increasing the dynamic bandwidth-per-core. The limitation of our work is that currently, it is applicable only to structured 3-D grids with cuts parallel to the Cartesian Axes. We emphasize and conclude that there is an imperative need to re-think domain decompositions in this constantly evolving multi-core era.","","978-1-5090-2088-1","10.1109/HPCSim.2016.7568426","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7568426","PDEs;Domain Decomposition;Stencil;Quasi-cache-directed;Cache-oblivious","Optimization;Jacobian matrices;Topology;Program processors;Load modeling;Mathematical model;Computer architecture","","4","","23","IEEE","15 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Such intelligent systems need to learn from the human intelligence about concept abstraction and analogical thinking in order to resolve complex issues using past experiences. The algorithms for abstraction and analogies are based on quick memory recall with clever information coding and processing. The quick and accurate memory recall is based on the fact that the memory mostly records the relations among the constituents of the stimulating signals, rather than the constituents themselves. Relational memories can be stored in the form of networks of neuron clusters capable of resonating to particular signal sequences. However, similarity testing for such network representations is difficult. We suggest that linear dynamic systems that relate the system matrix and the output time function can be used as a conversion mechanism between the network matrix and the temporal representations of the signals. This leads to algorithms for relational similarity testing and concept abstraction. Transient behavior based selection rules in ordinal optimization is important in achieving quickness in our development.","2378-5861","978-1-5090-5992-8","10.23919/ACC.2017.7963441","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7963441","","Resonant frequency;Transient analysis;Resonators;Intelligent systems;Signal processing;Computers;Neurons","","4","","17","","3 Jul 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, one can think of the following performance-enhancing techniques: caches, branch prediction, out-of-order (OoO) superscalar processing, simultaneous multi-threading (SMT). Clearly, there is a need for a platform that can deliver high performance for non-critical tasks and full analyzability and predictability for critical tasks (mixed-criticality systems). In this paper, we demonstrate how a polymorphic VLIW processor can satisfy these seemingly contradicting goals by allowing a schedule to dynamically, i.e., at run-time, distribute the computing resources to one or multiple threads. The core provides full performance isolation between threads and can keep multiple task contexts in hardware (virtual processors, similar to SMT) between which it can switch with minimal penalty (a pipeline flush). In this work, we show that this dynamic platform can improve performance over current predictable processors (by a factor of 5 on average using the highest performing configuration), and provides schedulability that is on par with an earlier study that explored the concept of creating a dynamic processor based on a superscalar architecture. Furthermore, we measured a 15% improvement in schedulability over a heterogeneous multi-core platform with an equal number of datapaths. Finally, our VHDL design and tools (including compiler, simulator, libraries etc.) are available for download for the academic community.","2325-1301","978-1-5386-1898-1","10.1109/RTCSA.2017.8046315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046315","","Dynamic scheduling;Schedules;VLIW;Context;Real-time systems;Multicore processing;Timing","","","","20","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We take this review as an opportunity to sketch out promising developments of cryo-EM in two important directions: (i) imaging of short-lived states (10–1000 ms) of biological molecules by using time-resolved cryo-EM, particularly the mixing-spraying method and (ii) recovering an entire continuum of coexisting states from the same sample by employing a computational technique called manifold embedding. It is tempting to think of combining these two methods, to elucidate the way the states of a molecular machine such as the ribosome branch and unfold. This idea awaits further developments of both methods, particularly by increasing the data yield of the time-resolved cryo-EM method and by developing the manifold embedding technique into a user-friendly workbench.","1477-9986","","10.1093/jmicro/dfv344","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8164418","classification;manifold embedding;microfluidics;ribosome;time-resolved imaging;translation","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This observation led some designers to think that a randomized mode of operation may be sufficient to protect block cipher encryption against this kind of threat. In this paper, we consider the case where the adversary neither chooses nor knows the input messages, and has only access to the faulty cipher texts. In this context, we are able to describe several attacks against AES-128 by using non uniform fault models. Our attacks target the last 4 rounds and allow to recover the correct key with practical time complexity, using a limited number of faulty cipher texts.

Unlike previous work where the non-task nodes (i.e., place nodes in the Petri-net) were lightly studied or even ignored, we think these non-task nodes also play an essential role in measuring the structural similarity between process models. First, we extract the context for each place and define the similarity for a pair of place nodes that are from different process models from two perspectives: commonality and the graph edit distance. Then, the place mapping is transformed to classical assignment problem that can be solved by Hungarian algorithm efficiently. Furthermore, we propose a new process similarity measurement on the basis of the place similarity. The extensive experimental evaluation shows that our Hungarian based methods outperform the baseline algorithm in both retrieval quality and query response time.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2016.2597143","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61602411,61173097,61572437); Key Research and Development Project of Zhejiang Province(grant numbers:2015C01034,2015C01029,2017C01013); Major Science and Technology Innovation Project of Hangzhou(grant numbers:20152011A03); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7529075","Process models;hungarian algorithm;structural similarity;query processing;petri net","Context;Computational modeling;Petri nets;Context modeling;Query processing;Companies","","26","","42","IEEE","2 Aug 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we put forward a novel user behavior-based method to detect the application layer asymmetric DDoS attack. We introduce an extended random walk model to describe user browsing behavior and establish the legitimate pattern of browsing sequences.

Since most graph data is collected in a relational database, it seems natural to attempt to perform graph analytics within the relational environment. However, SQL, the query language for relational databases, makes it difficult to express graph analytics operations. This is because SQL requires programmers to think in terms of tables and joins, rather than the more natural representation of graphs as collections of nodes and edges. As a result, even relatively simple graph operations can require very complex SQL queries. In this paper, we present GRAPHiQL, an intuitive query language for graph analytics, which allows developers to reason in terms of nodes and edges. GRAPHiQL provides key graph constructs such as looping, recursion, and neighborhood operations. At runtime, GRAPHiQL compiles graph programs into efficient SQL queries that can run on any relational database. We demonstrate the applicability of GRAPHiQL on several applications and compare the performance of GRAPHiQL queries with those of Apache Giraph (a popular `vertex centric' graph programming language).","","978-1-4799-5666-1","10.1109/BigData.2014.7004261","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7004261","","Database languages;Relational databases;Aggregates;Engines;Computational modeling;Vectors","","15","6","40","IEEE","8 Jan 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Rather than considering the automatic perception, this paper presents an artificial system of the goal-directed visual perception by using the object-based top-down visual attention mechanism. This cognitive system can guide the perception to an object of interest according to the current task, context and learned knowledge. It consists of three successive stages: preattentive processing, top-down attentional selection and post-attentive perception. The preattentive processing stage divides the input scene into homogeneous proto-objects, one of which is then selected by the top-down attention and finally sent to the post-attentive perception stage for high-level analysis.

To reduce the probability of common failures, development and procurement practices pursue ""diversity""' between the ways the different versions are developed. But difficult questions remain open about which practices are more effective to this aim. About these questions, probabilistic models have helped by exposing fallacies in ""common sense"" judgements. However, most make very restrictive assumptions. They model well scenarios in which diverse versions are developed in rigorous isolation from each other: A condition that many think desirable, but is unlikely in practice. We extend these models to cover nonindependent development processes for diverse versions. This gives us a rigorous way of framing claims and open questions about how best to pursue diversity, and about the effects--negative and positive--of commonalities between developments, from specification corrections to the choice of test cases. We obtain three theorems that, under specific scenarios, identify preferences between alternative ways of seeking diversity. We also discuss nonintuitive issues, including how expected system reliability may be improved by creating intentional ""negative""' dependences between the developments of different versions.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2013.32","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6579596","Common-mode failure;software diversity;fault tolerance;multiversion software;probability of failure on demand;reliability","Phase frequency detector;Software;Reliability;Random variables;Computational modeling;Correlation;Probabilistic logic","","9","","24","IEEE","15 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, using traces in open-system simulations retains the exact timestamps at which jobs are submitted. But in a real system these times depend on how users react to the performance of previous jobs, and it is more important to preserve the logical structure of dependencies between jobs than the specific timestamps. Using dependency information extracted from traces, we show how a simulation can preserve these dependencies. To do so we also extract user behavior, in terms of sessions and think times between the termination of one batch of jobs and the submission of a subsequent batch.","2375-0227","978-1-4799-5610-4","10.1109/MASCOTS.2014.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7033637","Workload trace;Feedback;Simulation","Throughput;Load modeling;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Reliability;Measurement;Time factors","","9","","25","IEEE","9 Feb 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It contains many well tested and high quality models of network protocols. However, the application layer models of ns-3 are very simplistic, and do not capture all aspects of real life applications. As a result, there is often a huge gap between the results of real experiments and the corresponding simulations. This problem is particularly exacerbated for wireless simulations, where many networking phenomena like wireless channel contention crucially depend on the application traffic characteristics. One way to bridge the gap between experiments and simulations is to incorporate knowledge from network traces into simulations. To this end, our work builds a trace-based application layer simulator in ns-3. Given a network trace collected from a user, our TraceReplay application layer model automatically generates traffic that is faithful to the real application in the ns-3 simulator. TraceReplay infers and replays only application layer delays like user think times, lets the simulator control the lower layer phenomena. TraceReplay extracts application layer characteristics from a single trace, and replays this information across many users in simulation, by using suitable randomization. Our model is also generic enough to replay any application layer protocol. Validation of our simulation model shows that simulation results obtained using TraceReplay are significantly different from those using other models, and are closer to experimental observations.","","978-1-5090-2361-5","10.1109/NCC.2016.7561126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7561126","","Delays;Protocols;Servers;Wireless communication;Computational modeling;Simulation;Data transfer","","7","","8","IEEE","8 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This requires new thinking not only on the necessary operational changes but also on the technological paradigms that determine our current service architectures. Driven by the availability of more and more bandwidth within wide area ground networks new technologies are emerging such as Cloud Computing. Beyond that, operational concepts of FAA's NEXTGEN and Europe's SESAR include dynamically moving the responsibility for airspace blocks from one facility to another, and ensuring continuity of operation by providing contingency operations. This contribution assesses the applicability of cloud computing in ATM, and the key differences to existing commercial applications. It presents the technical cloud computing elements necessary to achieve a truly global ATM system and addresses harmonization and interoperability aspects such as standardized working procedures and controller working positions equipment for air traffic controllers. Situational awareness is key for the decision making process of controllers and pilots in NEXTGEN. A key element different to commercial cloud applications is the necessity to communicate with aircraft and pilots as cloud participants via narrowband VHF radio communications, SATCOM, or other wireless communications technologies. Situational awareness of these participants is paramount which, in the current system, is automatically provided due to the broadcast nature of voice transmissions from controllers and pilots that can be received and heard by all listeners on a particular frequency nearly simultaneously (propagation delay of the radio signal not considered). To efficiently manage the access to this shared media and limit the access only to “relevant” participants, the concept of ATC sector within a geographical area, with boundaries (horizontal and vertical) aligned with traffic patterns exists today. This paper describes mechanisms that demonstrate how SATCOM, VHF, and various data link technologies can be integrated into a service cloud by virtualizing the sector concept and relaxing or completely removing the dependence on the underlying communications media. The advantage of this concept is that sectors can be dynamically defined based on operational ATM service needs without having to adhere to the coverage limitations of the underlying telecommunications service. The current ATM system is severely limited by the underlying telecommunications service models, most often by programmatic and contractual issues rather than their technical nature. We introduce the concept of a multi-point service within a virtual sector taking into consideration operational NEXTGEN issues and demands related to capacity, performance, and global coverage. Finally we introduce a new communications service model where selected parts of the infrastructure can be selectively and partially outsourced to certified service providers. This concept allows for smoother transition between the existing and next generation technologies, and reduces cost for the taxpayer while maintaining the safety of the flights.","2155-4951","978-1-4673-1900-3","10.1109/ICNSurv.2012.6218402","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6218402","","Cloud computing;Aircraft;Computational modeling;Availability;Standards organizations;Organizations","","6","","9","IEEE","18 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In these simulations, the workload has a huge influence on the measured performance of the simulated system. Therefore, it is customary to use workload traces recorded previously from real systems. Such open-system simulations preserve all the jobs' properties. However, preserving the jobs' arrival times actually destroys the logic of the user's workflow, especially dependencies and think times between successive jobs. Furthermore, performance in such simulations is measured by the average wait time and slowdown, under the fixed load and throughput conditions dictated by the trace. Therefore, it is impossible to evaluate the system's effect on throughput and productivity. As an alternative we propose semi-open trace based simulations that include dynamic user activity and internal feedback from the system to the users. In these simulations, like in a real system, users adjust their job-submittal behavior in response to system performance. As a result, the simulations produce different loads and throughputs for different scheduling algorithms or parametrizations. We implemented such a simulation for evaluating the schedulers of parallel job systems. We also developed a novel user-aware scheduler designed specifically to increase users' productivity. While conventional simulations cannot measure this scheduler's influence reliably, and would suggest it is useless, our simulation evaluates it realistically and shows its beneficial effect on the users' productivity and the system's throughput.","","978-1-4673-9560-1","10.1109/CloudCom.2015.35","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7396184","simulations;discrete-event simulation;performance evlauation;trace driven simulation;parallel system;scheduling;resampling;feedback","Load modeling;Throughput;Productivity;Uninterruptible power systems;Computational modeling;Data models;Cloud computing","","5","","27","IEEE","4 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, we think that the practical long-term on-line concept/word learning algorithm for robots is a key issue to be addressed. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised on-line learning algorithm that uses Bayesian nonparametrics for categorizing multimodal sensory signals such as audio, visual, and haptic information for robots. The robot uses its physical body to grasp and observe an object from various viewpoints as well as listen to the sound during the observation. The most important property of the proposed framework is to learn multimodal concepts and the language model simultaneously. This mutual learning framework of concepts and language significantly improves both speech recognition and multimodal categorization performances. We conducted a long-term experiment where a human subject interacted with a real robot over 100 hours using 499 objects. Some interesting results of the experiment are discussed in this paper.","2153-0866","978-1-5090-3762-9","10.1109/IROS.2016.7759410","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7759410","","Speech recognition;Robot sensing systems;Speech;Computational modeling;Data models;Visualization","","5","","22","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Software reliability growth model based on Bohrbugs and Mandelbugs","M. L.

The repeatable class, called Bohrbugs, always cause the same error with the same inputs. Prior thinking and reliability growth models were based on Bohrbugs, (Bbugs). Another class of errors called Mandelbugs, (Mbugs), are difficult to reproduce even with the same inputs, [1], [2]. Mbugs may be an interaction of inputs with computer storage, where computer storage represents the past history of inputs to the computer system [3]. A small fraction of Mbugs which increase with time, aging-related Mbugs, are ignored in the model. This paper formulates a software reliability growth model for predicting operational reliability of the software as development progresses. Based on prior experience, constant and exponentially decreasing error removal models are assumed. The inputs to the model are error removal data for both Bbugs and Mbugs, recorded during development testing and mean time to failure data from simulated operational tests. Simplified values for the model parameters are developed based on moment estimates. More sophisticated estimates using least squares and maximum likelihood techniques are discussed. The potential for improving the accuracy of reliability estimates by using models that incorporate both Bbugs and Mbugs is discussed with respect to two examples.","","978-1-5090-0406-5","10.1109/ISSRE.2015.7381831","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7381831","software reliability;growth model;Bohrbugs;Mandelbugs;prediction","Computer bugs;Software reliability;Software;Mathematical model;Data models;Computational modeling","","4","","16","IEEE","14 Jan 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brand Associations, one of central concepts in marketing, describe customers' top-of-mind attitudes or feelings toward a brand. (e.g. what comes to mind when you think of Burberry?) Traditionally, brand associations are measured by analyzing the text data from consumers' responses to the survey or their online conversation logs. In this paper, we go beyond textual media and take advantage of large-scale photos shared on the Web. More specifically, we jointly achieve the following two fundamental tasks in a mutually-rewarding way: (i) detecting exemplar images as key visual concepts associated with brands, and (ii) localizing the regions of brand in images. For experiments we collect about five millions of images of 48 brands crawled from five popular online photo sharing sites. We then demonstrate that our approach can discover complementary views on the brand associations that are hardly obtained from text data. We also quantitatively show the superior performance of our algorithm for the two tasks over other candidate methods.","","978-1-4799-3022-7","10.1109/ICCVW.2013.60","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6755926","Discovery of brand associations;Image cosegmentation;Exemplar detection","Image segmentation;Clustering algorithms;Visualization;Computer vision;Histograms;Computational modeling;Media","","4","","26","IEEE","6 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

According to the literature, the benefits of this approach include transparency, cost-efficiency, sharing of resources and the scalability of production. A multi-agent system-informed ontology used in manufacturing environments facilitates knowledge storage, inference and retrieval especially for the case of distributed resources. Based on service-oriented thinking, a cloud manufacturing OWL-S ontology model is proposed. Ontology mapping and an inference engine will be used to complete service request, publishing and binding processes. A new cloud-oriented manufacturing service OWL-S ontology would provide an extension to the Web framework, which introduces a semantic description of manufacturing services. This is for the cloud to build upon theoretical foundations and comply with standards. Manufacturing services are built in with a cloud-based negotiation mechanism using agent division, cooperation, competition and negotiation to achieve dynamic cloud manufacturing services' aggregation and running. ANALYSIS is a complex, non-linear, large cloud dynamic system for manufacturing. It is a cloud-based agent model represented in IDEF0 view, and functions on the basis of analysis of the mode of operation.

The goal of this paper is to present a different perspective of delivering security as a service thru a new defined concept, trust engines. This concept, introduced in this paper, relies on trust management. A trust management system can be achieved in cloud computing by implementing multiple trust models that define what a user can do and what type of protection he has. By identifying the static and dynamic trust models, the cloud provider and the cloud user can have a proper control of the cloud security. A trust model engine could create both static and dynamic rules that will establish a classified profile for all the cloud users.","","978-1-4673-5026-6","10.1109/SYNASC.2012.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6481067","trust;trust model;trust management;rule-based engine;evolutionary data engine;Drools;WSO2;KEEL","Engines;Business;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Authorization;Syntactics","","3","","12","IEEE","18 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This includes cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of academic courses taken, co-curriculum involvement, soft skills, hard work, leadership, attitude, time management, attendance, attire, and technical skill in order to make the selection decision. The distinctive student is identified firstly based on their overall score. The problem arises when one needs to evaluate all these different criteria in order to select or nominated a model student. It is a tedious task and time consuming for examiner or reviewer to analyze students individually in order to select a student that showed desirable performance. In addition, as a human has its limitation, there is a high degree of error in judgment in decision making. With the aim of bridging this gap, fuzzy logic is applied to imitate human analytic thinking or the ability to make a decision in the model student selection process. Thus, the system is able to assist examiner or evaluator in the decision-making process of determining the model student with minimal time and error. Furthermore, the user could dynamically change the criteria based on the traits that have been set by the system. Fuzzy logic is chosen as it is a powerful mathematical tool involving ambiguous and incomplete information supported by the experience and judgment of examiner or reviewer while combining this cognitive ability in order to reach a verdict. Therefore, the outputs from the experiment conducted shows that the system provides robust output and information to the user regarding student's aptitude and ultimately aim to effectively predict human judgment.","","978-1-5090-1636-5","10.1109/ICAICTA.2016.7803116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7803116","","Fuzzy logic;Pragmatics;Decision making;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Cognition;Mathematical model","","3","","17","IEEE","2 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some educators perceive the mobile devices as learning obstructers and think they should be abolished, however, research has revealed that if the devices are managed well, they can arouse the learner's curiosity to continue learning. The challenge is left to educators to figure out how to manage the learner's attention while using the mobile devices in class without compromising the quality of learning. With online learning tasks, observations and system login statistics as research instruments, this study investigated some of the factors that affected learners' attention and how they influence learner's engagement and learning outcomes in a mobile learning classroom. Using second year undergraduate learners as participants, each learner was allowed to connect and retrieve information from a content management system in order to access instructions and learning content. The learners interacted via chats, discussion forums and submit assignments online. Login data was captured and the lecturer observed learner behaviour. The results revealed that assignment feedback deadlines, instructions and content format, Learner Response time; and Learners' Self-Initiative, or drive played significant role in influencing learner's attention.","","978-1-5386-3837-8","10.23919/ISTAFRICA.2017.8102308","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8102308","Learner;Attention;Mobile Learning;pedagogy","Mobile communication;Mobile handsets;Education;Discussion forums;Computational modeling;Androids","","2","","43","","9 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This procedural animation solution uses bio-inspired insights (modelling nature and the workings of the brain) to unveil a new generation of intelligent agents. As with any promising new approach, it raises hopes and questions; an extremely challenging task that offers a revolutionary solution, not just in animation but to a variety of fields, from intelligent robotics and physics to nanotechnology and electrical engineering. Questions, such as, how does the brain coordinate muscle signals? How does the brain know which body parts to move? With all these activities happening in our brain, we examine how our brain ‘sees’ our body and how it can affect our movements. Through this understanding of the human brain and the cognitive process, models can be created to mimic our abilities, such as, synthesizing actions that solve and react to unforeseen problems in a humanistic manner. We present an introduction to the concept of cognitive skills, as an aid in finding and designing a viable solution. This helps us address principal challenges, such as: How do characters perceive the outside world (input) and how does this input influence their motions? What is required to emulate adaptive learning skills as seen in higher life-forms (e.g., a child's cognitive learning process)? How can we control and ‘direct’ these autonomous procedural character motions? Finally, drawing from experimentation and literature, we suggest hypotheses for solving these questions and more. In summary, this article analyses the biological and cognitive workings of the human mind, specifically motor skills. Reviewing cognitive psychology research related to movement in an attempt to produce more attentive behavioural characteristics. We conclude with a discussion on the significance of cognitive methods for creating virtual character animations, limitations and future applications.","","978-1-5090-4171-8","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821737","animation;life-like;movement;cognitive;biomechanics;human;reactive;responsive;instinctual;learning;adapting;biological;optimisation;modular;scalable","Animation;Adaptation models;Computational modeling;Biological system modeling;Kinematics;Brain modeling","","2","","54","IEEE","19 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We are constantly experiencing this serendipity element in our daily life. However, today's data mining technology cannot support this function adequately. In this paper, we hypothesize that there should be some relevant serendipity elements on a radio station's music playlist. The radio station makes the playlist for the programme by the producer or director based on his experience and huge knowledge of music. In this research, we first determine the optimal number of clusters to be used by using BIC and AIC, and then we apply EM model clustering technique for the collection of more than 3000 playlists from the radio station. By analyzing the resulting clusters obtained, significant dependency between clusters and all the playlist metadata (i.e. time, genre, music era, and popularity) are discovered. Finally, we found that the time of playing the music and the music era (composed-year of music) has a strong correlation. This implies that music in some particular music era is popular in certain particular time of the day. For example, more classical music pieces from modern era are played at the night from 18:00 until 2:00. Furthermore, more classical music from the early Baroque era has been played in the afternoon around 12.00 to 13.00. However, we think that some music, which belong to the music era that are less popular in that particular time, will contribute to the serendipity function of the playlist to certain extend. With these studies, this serendipity would be widely used for an excellent recommendation service, which will include the personal radio station for the digital music player, marketing and knowledge capital.","","978-1-4799-0400-6","10.1109/ICIEV.2013.6572614","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6572614","serendipity;data mining;data visualization;playlist;classical music;radio","Data visualization;Music;Internet;Mathematical model;Data models;Data mining;Computational modeling","","1","","14","IEEE","1 Aug 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Some previous scholars highlighted that without a healthy cash flow, an organisation can fail to sustain itself, even when it records huge profits and high return on investment. This paper explores further the issue of cash flow, as a key financial (and business) performance measure, with a particular focus on controls taken by an Engineering Consultant during the design stage of project execution when he/she forecasts a project cash flow shortfall. A System Dynamics conceptual model of the Engineering Consultant's project cash flow controls (and their associated unintended and undesirable effects) is formulated, in this paper, from existing literature, mental models of contemporary project managers (from an Engineering Consulting firm with many infrastructure projects in South Africa), and Systems Thinking. Results suggest some counterintuitive dynamic hypothesis: controls taken by an Engineering Consultant (aimed at increasing his/her project cash flow) when he/she forecasts a project cash flow shortfall, tend to generate some unintended and counteractive effect - a reduction of the Engineering Consultant's project cash flow.","","978-1-890843-36-6","10.23919/PICMET.2017.8125355","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8125355","","System dynamics;Investment;Computational modeling;Manufacturing;Data analysis;Atmospheric measurements","","1","","29","","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, in the abstraction dimension, one must think about scale, refinement, and hierarchy when modeling regardless of the type of modeling language.

While an existing VMX theory solved the fairness problem in a VERA algorithm based on a Pareto exchange point [3], a new expecation problem has been found such that exchange requesters might submit minimum acceptable rates (MAR) to determine whether to accept VMX systems-generated virtual currency exchange rates. When exchange requestors think the systems-generted rates are lower than MAR, they select not to accept the systems-generated rates. The withdrawal of systems-generated rates creates the expectation problem such that the fairness has been lost due to Pareto exchange point no longer exists. To solve the expectation problem, this paper has developed a new VERA-RS algorithm by extending the existing VERA algorithm based on a newly developed formal expectancy model and a novel m-stage and n-phase three-level computing framework. VERA-RS algorithm has solved expectation problem by achieving a set of satisfied virtual currency exchange rates.","","978-1-4799-2246-8","10.1109/CW.2013.42","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6680095","virtual world;virtual money;virtual currency;exchange rate;virtual wealth protection;algorithm","Exchange rates;Computational modeling;Algorithm design and analysis;Instruments;Force;Time series analysis","","","","12","IEEE","12 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Automatic processing and recognition of facial expressions is hence one of the core areas in computer vision, computer graphics, and social signal processing. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and their extensions are widely used for recognizing facial expressions. Most research in this area, however, is done either with a limited set of emotional expressions (such as the six universal expressions), or it concentrates on extracting facial action units (individual muscle movements) from video sequences. Little research has been conducted to analyze the complex facial movements that occur in conversational contexts. Conversational expressions such as ""agree"", ""disagree"", ""thinking"", ""looking confused"", however, form an integral part of non-verbal communication and systems that can automatically parse and understand such expressions are a key ingredient for the development of efficient human-computer interaction systems. Since conversational expressions may consists of several sub-expressions and contain complex dynamics, however, standard CRF approaches are not suited for the task. In this paper, we conduct a detailed comparison of CRFs and Latent Dynamic Conditional Random Fields (LDCRFs) for recognizing complex conversational expressions. We show the importance of modeling sub-expression dynamics and discuss challenges for applying LDCRFs to recognize a large set of conversational expressions.","0730-6512","978-1-4799-2190-4","10.1109/ACPR.2013.98","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6778408","Facial Expression Analysis;Sequence Modeling;Human Computer Interaction","Databases;Computational modeling;Training;Face recognition;Hidden Markov models;Vectors;Feature extraction","","","","18","IEEE","27 Mar 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is a design strategy where system designers think in terms of 'things' instead of operations or functions. Object-Oriented software projects are becoming more popular than structured or functional technology based projects. While Object-Oriented modeling are already arriving in the marketplace but their formal foundations are still under development. Object Technology offers support to deliver products to market more quickly and to provide high quality with lower maintenance costs. Quality Assurance is an important field of software engineering and there is need for good Object-Oriented metrics and models for both process and product. The quality of object-oriented design has a decisive impact on the quality of a software product, but due to the diversity and complexity of design properties like coupling, encapsulation etc their assessment and correlation with external quality attributes like maintenance, portability etc is hard. To address these issues, we will use the innovative solution (TRIZ) to enhance quality with available Object-oriented metrics and affecting factors. TRIZ is a problem-solving, analysis and forecasting tool that is abbreviation of Russian word Teoriya Resheniya Izobretatelskikh Zadatch which typically rendered as the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving. The objective of TRIZ is development of an algorithmic approach to the invention of new systems, and the refinement of existing ones. In this paper we will apply TRIZ to Object-oriented Models to enhance the quality of Object-oriented design.

However, we think the conformity information is also important for the sale prediction of time-sensitive products, since conformity impacts people's purchase decisions. In this paper, we propose a model which captures the dynamic conformity and apply it to the similarity computation and sale prediction of time-sensitive products. It can be dynamically adjusted to fit the target product and the prediction moment, which means it is well self-adaptive. Since it also gives the consideration to other static and latent features in a collaborative way, it alleviates the ""cold start"" problem nicely and is free from the presetting hypotheses.

In this setting, the selection of appropriate IT services is critical. Following the discussions of environmental thinking in IT aspects like Green IT and Green IS, the issue of appropriate IT service depends on not only functionality and costs, but additionally also on the environmental impact of the service selection. To address this issue, this paper presents a service selection model for cloud-based services with a focus on the environmental aspects of the selection process. This is done by modeling a multi-criteria decision model based on the rational choice theory. The proposed model provides a selection process which leads to maximal service functionality coverage with minimal environmental impact for a given service provider setting.

The ongoing trends towards urbanization, global travel, climate change and a generally older and immuno-compromised population continue to make epidemic planning and control challenging. Recent quantitative changes in high performance pervasive computing have created new opportunities for collecting, integrating, analyzing and accessing information related to large urban social systems, disease surveillance and global logistics and supply chains. The advances in network and information science that build on this new capability provide entirely new ways for reasoning and controlling epidemics. In this talk I will overview of the state of the art in computational networked epidemiology with an emphasis on computational thinking and on the development of high performance computing oriented decision-support environments for planning and response in the event of epidemics. I will describe how such systems can be used to support near real-time planning and response during the 2009 H1N1 swine flu and the recent Ebola Outbreak in West Africa. Computational challenges and directions for future research will be discussed.","1530-2075","978-1-4799-8649-1","10.1109/IPDPS.2015.121","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7161569","","Planning;High performance computing;Africa;Urban areas;Surveillance;Supply chains;Statistics","","2","","","IEEE","20 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (1018 bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O), can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a single machine.","1558-2256","","10.1109/JPROC.2015.2494219","Army Research Office; Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; U.S. Department of Energy; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7355313","Big data;distributed matrix algorithms;least absolute deviation;least squares;preconditioning;randomized linear algebra;subspace embedding;Big data;distributed matrix algorithms;least absolute deviation;least squares;preconditioning;randomized linear algebra;subspace embedding","Algorithm design and analysis;Approximation methods;Approximation algorithms;Distributed databases;Machine learning algorithms;Matrix decomposition;Big data","","20","","71","IEEE","17 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, in recent years, there has been a blooming of attractive programming environments specifically designed to expose young students (e.g., middle school age) to computational thinking. Alice is a very popular introductory programming environment, focused on programming through animations and story-telling. This paper introduces a novel extension of the Alice framework that enables interaction and collaboration among students in the development of programs. In particular, the new version of Alice described in this paper provides support for virtual pair programming.

The programming concepts and the fostered pedagogical environment were implemented in three-hour evening sessions over 15 weeks in which the students were encouraged to develop programming communities while working on computational thinking concept strands. The research findings that we report are threefold. First, we report on how we fostered building programming concepts into the curriculum into a set of activities specifically designed for an immigrant engineer retraining program with students ranging in backgrounds. We found that at that the program curriculum must be flexible enough for student learning regardless of the fact that a student may miss sessions. Second, we report on how an effective pedagogical environment, which fosters student-centered learning, was promoted so that the students could construct their own meanings of the programming concepts. Third, we report on implementation strategies unique to a retraining program, such as specific environmental constraints as well as how sessions were partitioned into components that fostered computational thinking while learning Java. Our findings provide unique insights into intervention constraints for an urban retraining program which can be used to guide and inform further retraining computer learning program research.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190558","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190558","","Java;Education;Programming profession;Urban areas","","1","","44","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Distinguishing single-stranded and double-stranded DNA binding proteins based on structural information","W. Wang; J. Liu","School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R. China; School of Computer, Wuhan University, Wuhan, P.R. China",2013 IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine,"6 Feb 2014","2013","","","612","612","Protein-DNA interactions play a critical role in many biological processes. However, the structural mechanisms underlying these interactions are not fully understood. DNA binding proteins can be classified into double-stranded DNA binding proteins (DSBs) and single-stranded DNA binding proteins (SSBs). Understanding the binding specificity of a DNA binding protein is helpful for the research of protein functions. Though there are some researches [1] on the SSB and DSB respectively, few attentions have been paid on investigating what makes SSB and DSB have such different ability of the specific binding. With the development of biotechnology, a large amount of proteins has been sequenced. However, SSBs have shown to have little sequence conservation [2]. Even DSBs involved in similar functions may have conserved subsequences, different kinds of DSBs with different functions seems to show few common subsequences. Therefore, it is hard to recognize SSB sequences from DSB sequences, or vice versa. In fact, up to Jan. 25, 2013, the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [3] contains 3391 structures for DNA binding proteins, among them only about 30% and 5% are annotated as DSBs and SSBs, respectively, and whether the remainders belong to DSBs or SSBs are still not very clear. Therefore, a computational method is required to annotate the DNA binding protein as DSB or SSB automatically. The surface of a protein is generally irregular, containing many clefts and grooves of varying shapes and sizes. Previous researches have shown that a large cleft can provide an increased opportunity for the protein to form interactions with other molecules, particularly small ligands [4]. Therefore, some researches used a particularly large and deep cleft to characterize the binding active sites of the proteins [5]. We guess that for DNA binding proteins, the cleft properties on the surface may also play important roles on the dsDNA/ssDNA binding specificity. In this work, we applied CAVER 3.0 package [6] to detect the clefts and the corresponding indexes of the largest clefts on the protein surfaces, to investigate whether they are possible to be used for distinguishing the potential interfaces between SSBs and DSBs. Concretely, we mainly got three indexes of the detected tunnels: length, curvature and bottleneck radius. Research results have shown that although the sequences of different SSBs are very different, there are well-conserved elements in the structures. That is, most SSBs contain one or more OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) - fold domains [2]. A typical OB-fold has a five-stranded beta-sheet coiled to form a closed beta-barrel. This barrel is capped by an alpha-helix located between the third and fourth strands. The OB-fold plays critical role in binding with ssDNA. Although it is hard to say that the OB-fold is unique for SSBs, we think that it should also be used as an important descriptor to distinguish SSBs from DSBs. Therefore, we use the protein structure alignment package TM-align [7] to compare its structure with each of the six OB-fold protein templates and use the maximal alignment score TM-score as the OB-fold feature of the protein. We aim to investigate the structural differences between collected SSBs and DSBs, and extract the structure-based features related to surface clefts and OB-folds, Based on which, we construct a computational model that can automatically classify the DNA protein as a DSB or SSB by using the widely used support vector machine (SVM), with prediction accuracy of HOLO-set 0.87, APO-set 0.83, and mixed-set 0.83, respectively. The promising performance suggests that our method will be useful in the protein function annotation and refinement.

For further applications of HFLTSs to decision making, we develop a concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic preference relations (HFLPRs) as a tool to collect and present the DMs' preferences. Due to the importance of the consistency measures using preference relations in decision making, we develop some consistency measures for HFLPRs to ensure that the DMs are being neither random nor illogical. A consistency index is defined to establish the consistency thresholds of HFLPRs to measure whether an HFLPR is of acceptable consistency. For HFLPRs with unacceptable consistency, we develop two optimization methods to improve the consistency until they are acceptable.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no fuzzy combination method has been proposed, which is composed of a fuzzy rule-based system. We think this can be a very promising research line as it allows us to benefit from the key advantage of fuzzy systems, i.e., their interpretability. By using a fuzzy linguistic rule-based classification system as a combination method, the resulting classifier ensemble would show a hierarchical structure, and the operation of the latter component would be transparent to the user. Moreover, for the specific case of fuzzy multiclassification systems, the new approach could also become a smart way to allow standard fuzzy classifiers to deal with high-dimensional problems, avoiding the curse of dimensionality, as the chance to perform classifier selection at class level is also incorporated, into the method. We conduct comprehensive experiments considering 20 UCI datasets with different dimensionality, where our approach improves or at least maintains accuracy, while reducing complexity of the system, and provides some interpretability insight into the multiclassification system reasoning mechanism. The results obtained show that this approach is able to compete with the state-of-the-art multiclassification system selection and fusion methods in terms of accuracy, thus providing a good interpretability-accuracy tradeoff.","1941-0034","","10.1109/TFUZZ.2012.2236844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6399459","Bagging;classifier fusion;classifier selection;fuzzy rule-based multiclassification systems;genetic fuzzy systems;interpretability–accuracy tradeoff;linguistic selection and fusion of individual classifiers","Pragmatics;Training;Fuzzy systems;Bagging;Fuzzy reasoning;Complexity theory;Genetics","","35","","68","IEEE","3 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our work as instructors with high school students, we have detected these and other bad practices, such as the repetition of code and object naming, on a regular basis. This paper focuses on verifying whether these issues can generally be found in the Scratch community, by analyzing a large number of projects available on the Scratch community website. To test this hypothesis, we downloaded 100 projects and analyzed them with two plug-ins we developed to automatically detect these bad practices. The plug-ins extend the functionality of the Hairball tool, a static code analyzer for Scratch projects.

Cryptography and steganography, a sub-discipline of information hiding, are two distinct popular security offering techniques. To get the combined chemistry from these techniques, today's real-time security systems include both cryptography and steganography in their working principle. To cope up with those systems, we have proposed a format-based pure text steganography algorithm including a private key cryptography providing a higher level of security. The cover text has been made as ordinary as possible. After successful embedding of the secret message into the cover text, the stego-text also looks like an ordinary text because only an alphanumeric puzzle is added at the end of the cover text to make up the stego-text.

In addition to feedback based on run-time and output checking, we are particularly interested in immediate feedback: corrective guidance given as the program is being constructed. Immediate feedback is a natural extension of the block-based language philosophy. Block-based languages prevent by design certain types of mistakes in all cases. Immediate feedback guides against, without fully preventing, problem-specific mistakes (i.e., constructions that are erroneous in only some cases). A feedback specification contains a block pattern and a set of actions that can be taken whenever the corresponding pattern is present or absent in the student's block program for a given problem. The paper illustrates the language through several examples derived from misconceptions found in the block-based programs of students taking a university-level Computational Thinking class. The feasibility of the proposed approach is shown by the translation of a specification using an evolving programmatic interface in BlockPy, a dual block/text programming environment for a subset of Python.","","978-1-5386-2480-7","10.1109/BLOCKS.2017.8120407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8120407","Immediate feedback;formative feedback;block-based languages;novice programming environments","Programming;Semantics;Programming environments;Specification languages;Meteorology;Syntactics;Temperature","","6","","12","IEEE","30 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As creating a cyberspace workforce has become a matter of national security for every country, cybersecurity needs to be taught at all levels, to all students, in the educational system. The good news is that cybersecurity is also a topic that students from a wide variety of backgrounds find interesting, and as a result, it motivates them to study computing too. Over the past two decades, there has been an increased effort worldwide to incorporate computer science and computational thinking into the middle and high school curriculum. The CS10K initiative in the US has led to projects to introduce computer science at the K-12 educational level. One of these initiatives, the new Advanced Placement (AP) course in Computer Science Principles (CSP), was designed to introduce computer science in an engaging way, show students how computing is relevant in their lives, and to attract a diverse group of students to computing. The CSP Curriculum Framework allows for multiple implementations of the CSP course, permitting course designers to develop courses to engage and attract specific groups of students and that focus on specific themes in computing. This paper describes an approach to develop a new CSP course, CyberCSP, which integrates cybersecurity first principles throughout the course. The approach builds on an CSP course that was created from a previous collaboration between the Computer Science Department at Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, and the Webster Central School District in Webster, New York. The paper discusses the background, details of the earlier CSP course, how relevant cybersecurity content was identified, and then integrated into the CSP course to create the CyberCSP variant of the Computer Science Principles course.","","978-1-5090-5920-1","10.1109/FIE.2017.8190711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8190711","","Computer science;Collaboration;Employment;Computer crime","","1","","20","IEEE","14 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For operations in real environments, we have to consider severe conditions under which communications between UxVs may be inadequate and the environment changes unexpectedly. In addition to optimality, adaptability (meaning robustness to severe and unexpected conditions) is important in real situations. However, there are no quantitative benchmarks for algorithms to have both optimality and adaptability. Here, to reconcile optimality and adaptability, we have developed an “autonomous and adaptive control”. The distinctive features of this algorithm is that it simply uses the purposes of a system, such as efficiencies, to control elements and it has a distributed optimization architecture without a centralized control unit. We think that it is promising for autonomous swarm control with optimality and adaptability in real environments. In this paper, we benchmark several swarm control algorithms including our own. We compare two conventional algorithms with ours in a scenario involving a continuous search operation where the UxVs keep moving and searching. We also devise performance indicators for this operation and evaluate the algorithms in terms of them. The results obtained from computational simulations show that our algorithm maintains the efficiency of the search operation at a high level. That means the algorithm is a promising approach for achieving both optimality and adaptability.","","978-0-6929-4690-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8232245","","Uncertainty;Adaptation models;Adaptive control;Indexes;Actuators;Unmanned vehicles;Benchmark testing","","","","12","","25 Dec 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Due to the fast growing mobile industry the current devices usually contain wireless (Wi-Fi, 3G, 4G and Bluetooth), GPS and other heavy network sensitive technologies. The cell battery manufacturers usually cannot keep the pace with this fast altering environment and demands, hence the devices get inappropriate battery. Recently many researchers deal with this topic trying to find out a reasonable solution for energy optimization without compromising the functionality of the devices. A possible approach to deal with the problem today and achieve the desired result is the code side optimization. The market based mobile application distribution model makes this challenge harder. Sometimes the code quality of the uploaded applications are poor and the market owners are not able to force the developers to write clear and energy efficient code, they can only give them recommendations. The question is coming up: how could we still encourage the individual developers and companies to write optimized and a bit more standardized code? The answer could be delivering them tools to facilitate the refactoring and code quality managing processes. One way we can deal with energy problem is to reorganize the heavy computational tasks out of the device to the cloud or to just another machine. This technique is called “offloading”. In this paper we are going to introduce a new code generation extension for software engineers which is aiming to automate the offload to web services. Those services can then be easily deployed to any desired location to ease the mobile devices computational task. We think this tool would be really helpful to the community and the industrial users also.","2158-5210","978-1-4799-3104-0","10.1109/INTLEC.2014.6972195","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6972195","","Optimization;Mobile communication;Visualization;Measurement;Software;Mobile handsets;Generators","","","1","7","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, past methodologies for balancing the roles and functionalities between humans and computers in complex systems have little connection to different types of required cognition, behaviors, or tasks, or don't address the role of uncertainty in the environment. To augment these previous role allocation approaches, this article presents a modification to the skill, rule, and knowledge-based behavior taxonomy that includes expertise and uncertainty. Skill-based behaviors are the best candidates for automation, assuming significant sensor performance assumptions can be met, but rule and knowledge-based reasoning are better suited for human-computer collaboration. Such systems should be designed so that humans harness the raw computational and search power of computers for state-space reduction, but also allow them the latitude to apply their expertise in uncertain situations through inductive reasoning for potentially creative, out-of-the-box thinking.","1941-1294","","10.1109/MIS.2014.87","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6949509","automation;computer-supported collaborative work;systems analysis and design;interactive systems;intelligent systems","Human computer interaction;Automation;Human factors;Man machine systems;Resource management;Information processing","","78","","15","IEEE","7 Nov 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

To address this problem, various mutation reduction strategies have been proposed, all seeking to reduce the number of mutants while maintaining the representativeness of an exhaustive mutation analysis. While research has focused on the reduction achieved, the effectiveness of these strategies in selecting representative mutants, and the limits in doing so have not been investigated, either theoretically or empirically. We investigate the practical limits to the effectiveness of mutation reduction strategies, and provide a simple theoretical framework for thinking about the absolute limits. Our results show that the limit in improvement of effectiveness over random sampling for real-world open source programs is a mean of only 13.078%. Interestingly, there is no limit to the improvement that can be made by addition of new mutation operators. Given that this is the maximum that can be achieved with perfect advance knowledge of mutation kills, what can be practically achieved may be much worse. We conclude that more effort should be focused on enhancing mutations than removing operators in the name of selective mutation for questionable benefit.","1558-1225","978-1-4503-3900-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7886930","software testing; statistical analysis; theoretical analysis; mutation analysis","Sociology;Software engineering;Testing;Computer bugs;Syntactics;Correlation","","13","","54","","3 Apr 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to accomplish this goal, and based on the consensus that computer science is not programming and that programming languages are a tool, visual languages have become the preferred method for teaching introductory courses in computer science. The absence of rigid syntactic rules makes them the ideal tool for focusing on problem solving and computational thinking activities.

We also list some typical spatial questions that might be posed for spatial analysis and computation. The principle introduced in this paper could be applied not only to desktop-GIS software but also to web map services.

Therefore, when we deal with a large number of datasets, there should be a way to accelerate the process by applying acceleration techniques to optimize the plagiarism detection. In response to this, we have developed a parallel algorithm using Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) and tested it on a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) platform. An equivalent algorithm is run on CPU platform as well. From the comparison of the results, CPU shows better performance when the number and the size of the documents are small. Meantime, GPU is an effective and efficient platform when handling a large number of documents and high in data size due to the increase in the amount of parallelism. It was found out that for our dataset, the performance of the algorithm on the GPU platform is approximately 6x faster than CPU.

We implement this method as a game called Bodhi in which each player is shown a piece of code snippet and asked to choose whether their partner would think there is a buffer overflow vulnerability at a given position in the code.

Their success has shown that they are simple enough for a huge number of end users to learn and use. This is in contrast to traditional programming languages and the high dropout rate from introductory programming and computer science. However in comparison to traditional programming languages and structured modelling, spreadsheets are not expressive, placing a limit on the levels of computational thinking that can be taught using the spreadsheet paradigm. This limitation is imposed by the lack of programming language features and abstractions in the paradigm. Furthermore, more advanced spreadsheet features (e.g. array formulae, lookup formulae, R1C1 syntax) can be difficult to learn and use. This paper discusses the idea of adding language features to spreadsheets, enabling the gradual structuring of free-form spreadsheets to more structured models. We propose that this concept is termed Gradual Structuring, and is analogous to the programming language concept of gradual typing. In this analogy, spreadsheets take the place of dynamic programming and structured modelling of static programming. In programming languages, gradual typing allows dynamic programming to be mixed with static programming. It is our contention that dynamic programming is more learnable while static programming is more expressive and abstract. Gradual typing could be used to mitigate the issues in the teaching of traditional programming. Likewise Gradual Structuring can mitigate the conceptual limits that can be taught using current spreadsheets. The key language feature required to enable Gradual Structuring is the ability to logically group cells together so that a single formula can be applied to the grouped cells. This concept, termed cell grouping diminishes and can even eliminate the need for the ubiquitous and error-prone use of copy-pasted in spreadsheets. Moreover, it makes the structure present in spreadsheet models explicit. Cell grouping requires a cascade of other new languages features. Namely a more expressive referencing style, which in turned requires enabling labels to be moved to the row and column headers, and the hierarchical structuring of these headers. Respectively these language features are termed enhanced referencing and semantic axes. The ongoing research focusses on the usability and learnability of these language features. Spreadsheet applications exist that contain aspects of the features mentioned. However these applications do not enable Gradual Structuring and have taken a mainly technical, not human behavioural, approach to evolving the spreadsheet.","","978-1-5090-0778-3","10.1109/ITHET.2016.7760759","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7760759","","Programming profession;Computer languages;Dynamic programming;Electronic mail;Education;Semantics","","2","","50","IEEE","1 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For ICT to effectively contribute to the national development agenda however, there is a need to ensure that citizens are ICT literate. As a result, a number of countries have developed Subject Policy Guidelines aimed at introducing Computer Studies at Secondary School level. While most of these guidelines are carefully crafted, actual implementation in secondary schools has proved troublesome; having under-maintained or non-existent ICT infrastructures along with inadequately trained teachers as major obstacles. Subsequently, most African student's first exposure to computer programming occurs in the first year of university education, thus entering the Computer Science major without any prior hands-on experience. The Namibian Technology Outreach to Secondary Schools (NAMTOSS) initiative is a pilot program started by the School of Computing (SoC) at the University of Namibia (UNAM) in March 2016. NAMTOSS is a partnership between secondary school teachers, learners and the staff members of the School of Computing at UNAM that is designed to introduce computer programming skills and computational thinking at secondary school level.

It presents a new estimation of distribution algorithm based on the swarm behavior of fireflies. The proposed algorithm is called the compact firefly optimizer (cFO). It uses a compact representation to store the population of the fireflies. Thus, the whole population is represented by a probabilistic distribution function. The compact swarm intelligence proposed allows the reduction of the computational capacity required to evolve the population toward the optimal solution. An important numerical test is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The results obtained show that the proposed compact firefly optimizer (cFO) is very competitive. Furthermore, the new concepts of compact swarm robotics are also introduced. The algorithm is applied to describe the first compact swarm robotics system. The objective is to realize an optimal stable walking by bipedal robot.

In a complex decision making scenario, which requires maintaining high level of attention continuously and deep understanding about the task and its context, the use of embodied interaction has the potential to promote thinking and learning. Creating a framework that allows decision makers to interact with information using the whole body in intuitive ways may offer cognitive advantages and greater efficiency. This paper proposes such a computational framework based on a Bayesian approach (coined BAN) to infer operators' focus of attention based on the operators' physical expressions. Then, utility theory is adopted in order to determine the best combinations of interaction modalities and feedback. Experiments involving five physical interaction modalities (touchless, glove-based, and step gestures, speech, and body balance) and two feedback modalities (visual and sound) were conducted to assess the proposed framework's performance. This also includes the likelihood of assessed attention from enhanced BANs and task performance as a function of the interaction and control modalities. Results show that physical expressions have a determining factor in the quality of the solutions in spatio-navigational type of problems.","1062-922X","978-1-4799-3840-7","10.1109/SMC.2014.6974084","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6974084","Embodied interaction;Bayesian modeling;Hybrid human-machine system","Cities and towns;Bayes methods;Speech;Torso;Measurement;Decision making;Navigation","","2","","19","IEEE","4 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Cognitive radio offers a new way of thinking on how to promote efficient use of the radio spectrum by exploiting the existence of spectrum holes. In a related context, the spectrum‐utilization efficiency of cognitive radio is assessed in the context of four practical system issues: accuracy and reliability, computational speed, management of resources and coexistence of the cognitive radio network alongside the legacy radio network. A principled basis for the dynamic allocation and management of resources in a cognitive radio network is developed based on the fusion of ideas from game theory, control theory, and optimization. The chapter reviews the dominant sources of uncertainty in cognitive radio networks. It also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book.","","9781119405832","10.1002/9781119405818.ch1","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8043524.pdf&bkn=8040333&pdfType=chapter","","Cognitive radio;Supply chains;Production facilities;Sensors;Decision making","","","","","","22 Sep 2017","","","Wiley","Wiley Telecom eBook Chapters"

The latter can be done if algorithms can efficiently be mapped to hardware-specific functional blocks that require different style of thinking and manipulation by different operations and memory models. Besides, concurrency (pipelining and parallelism) can be widely applied. This paper focuses on data processing algorithms that use values of incoming data items as memory addresses with one-bit flags indicating presence or absence of data. The main problem of similar known methods is an appearance of huge number of memory cells with no data items (empty holes), which, nevertheless, have to be processed involving lots of unnecessary time. It is proposed to apply N-ary tree technique that enables data items to be stored and found very fast through executing special traversal procedure. Such trees completely differ from known tree-walk tables because they have pre-established configuration that does not require explicit addresses of subsequent (child) nodes. As a result the size of memory needed to keep data items is decreased in number of times. Finally, significantly more complicated problems can be solved faster and with smaller hardware resources. The presented results of numerous experiments clearly demonstrate advantages of the proposed method compared to known implementations.","","978-1-4673-2232-4","10.1109/EUROCON.2013.6625220","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6625220","data processing;N-ary tree;hardware implementation;FPGA;sort;search","Hardware;Field programmable gate arrays;Data processing;Memory management;Sorting;Vectors;Encoding","","","","27","IEEE","10 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The realization of this grand potential relies on the ability to extract value from such massive data through data analytics; machine learning is at its core because of its ability to learn from data and provide data driven insights, decisions, and predictions. However, traditional machine learning approaches were developed in a different era, and thus are based upon multiple assumptions, such as the data set fitting entirely into memory, what unfortunately no longer holds true in this new context. These broken assumptions, together with the Big Data characteristics, are creating obstacles for the traditional techniques. Consequently, this paper compiles, summarizes, and organizes machine learning challenges with Big Data. In contrast to other research that discusses challenges, this work highlights the cause–effect relationship by organizing challenges according to Big Data Vs or dimensions that instigated the issue: volume, velocity, variety, or veracity. Moreover, emerging machine learning approaches and techniques are discussed in terms of how they are capable of handling the various challenges with the ultimate objective of helping practitioners select appropriate solutions for their use cases. Finally, a matrix relating the challenges and approaches is presented.

Aimed at improving the deficiencies of traditional integrated data stream analysis, a human-like remembering and forgetting mechanism is introduced into data stream analysis, and a deep data stream analysis model based on remembering (DSAR) is proposed. Through this remembering and forgetting mechanism, the model regards basic classifiers as system-obtained knowledge and not only stores useful basic classifiers in a “remembering library” to improve prediction stability but also selects good basic classifiers to participate in integrated prediction, thus improving its ability to accommodate conceptual variations. Based on the DSAR model, an integrated deep data stream analysis (DDSA) algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses the forgetting curve and a selective ensemble classifier to simulate human thinking. Compared with four typical data stream analysis algorithms, the DDSA algorithm has a high classification accuracy and a strong capacity for accommodating concept drift features (CDFs) within data stream analysis. The DDSA is particularly adaptable to complex CDFs in practical applications. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm can not only adapt to new concept changes quickly but also effectively resist the impact of random fluctuations on system performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2016.2613922","Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LY16F020012); Ningbo Key Laboratory of intelligent home appliances(grant numbers:2016A22008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7577724","Data stream analysis;remembering and ignoring;ignoring curve;selective ensemble","Classification algorithms;Algorithm design and analysis;Prediction algorithms;Data analysis;Analytical models;Data models;Predictive models","","5","","24","OAPA","27 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

So it is with our present day; this raises the question, what must a functioning member of society know about computing?

While these techniques allow practitioners to obtain policies for fairly large problems, they assume that a non-negligible amount of computation can be done between each decision point. In contrast, the recent proliferation of mobile and embedded devices has lead to a surge of applications that could benefit from state of the art planning techniques if they can operate under severe constraints on computational resources. For instance, consider the emerging class of monitoring and assistive applications that run on smart-phones, wearable systems or other mobile devices. While computational resources are rapidly increasing, energy consumption remains an important bottleneck due to limited battery life. In this talk, I will present some experiments about battery consumption for various types of planning policies on smart-phones. I will then present recent results for the optimization and compilation of policies into controllers with negligible energy consumption during their execution. I will also present recent advances in multi-objective optimization to tradeoff the utility and energy costs resulting from different actions.","2376-6824","978-1-4673-9606-6","10.1109/TAAI.2015.7407051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7407051","","","","","","","IEEE","15 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"Magnetotelluric 3-D inversion—a review of two successful workshops on forward and inversion code testing and comparison","M. P. Miensopust; P. Queralt; A. G. Jones",NA; NA; NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","2013","193","3","1216","1238","Over the last half decade the need for, and importance of, three-dimensional (3-D) modelling of magnetotelluric (MT) data have increased dramatically and various 3-D forward and inversion codes are in use and some have become commonly available. Comparison of forward responses and inversion results is an important step for code testing and validation prior to ‘production’ use. The various codes use different mathematical approximations to the problem (finite differences, finite elements or integral equations), various orientations of the coordinate system, different sign conventions for the time dependence and various inversion strategies. Additionally, the obtained results are dependent on data analysis, selection and correction as well as on the chosen mesh, inversion parameters and regularization adopted, and therefore, a careful and knowledge-based use of the codes is essential. In 2008 and 2011, during two workshops at the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies over 40 people from academia (scientists and students) and industry from around the world met to discuss 3-D MT inversion. These workshops brought together a mix of code writers as well as code users to assess the current status of 3-D modelling, to compare the results of different codes, and to discuss and think about future improvements and new aims in 3-D modelling. To test the numerical forward solutions, two 3-D models were designed to compare the responses obtained by different codes and/or users. Furthermore, inversion results of these two data sets and two additional data sets obtained from unknown models (secret models) were also compared. In this manuscript the test models and data sets are described (supplementary files are available) and comparisons of the results are shown. Details regarding the used data, forward and inversion parameters as well as computational power are summarized for each case, and the main discussion points of the workshops are reviewed. In general, the responses obtained from the various forward models are comfortingly very similar, and discrepancies are mainly related to the adopted mesh. For the inversions, the results show how the inversion outcome is affected by distortion and the choice of errors, as well as by the completeness of the data set. We hope that these compilations will become useful not only for those that were involved in the workshops, but for the entire MT community and also the broader geoscience community who may be interested in the resolution offered by MT.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggt066","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8179980","Numerical solutions;Inverse theory;Magnetotelluric;Geomagnetic induction","","","8","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

"Bee Counters: Measuring a nest's occupation by its capacitance [Resources_Hands On]","P. Perrault; M.

While there has been a lot of attention paid to Western honeybees owing to colony collapse disorder, this specific disease and others like it are really measurable only once a colony collapses. And in any case, honeybees are not the only important bee pollinators. What we need is the ability to measure and monitor bee activity as it happens. - Historically, such monitoring was the purview of undergraduates armed with clipboards. More recently, optical sensors have allowed for the automatic detection of bees entering and exiting the hive. But placing optical sensors in a habitat of pollen, mud, and other hive debris drastically degrades their effectiveness. What if there was a better way? - A solution suggested itself when the two of us--a field applications engineer for Analog Devices and an amateur bee enthusiast--were working together on a previous project that involved capacitive sensing. Teachman (the bee enthusiast) commented to Perrault (the applications engineer) that the sensitivity of the AD7746 capacitance-to-digital conversion chip was better than he had expected, and wondered, ""Do you think we could measure bees with this?"" All else being equal, the capacitance between two electrodes depends on the dielectric constant of the substance between them. Air has a dielectric constant of roughly 1, while water comes in at around 80. As living cells are mostly water, a bee should have a detectable dielectric signature. Intrigued by the idea, we developed a custom sensor setup to measure just that.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2016.7419791","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7419791","","","","2","","","IEEE","29 Feb 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
